<span class="caption">BESSIE AND I AND BESSIE&#8217;S MOTHER.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="floatleft">&#8220;</span><span class="dropcap">W</span>hy,</span> Charlie, you sha&#8217;n&#8217;t talk so about my
mother! I won&#8217;t allow it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does sound a little rough, my dear; but I
can&#8217;t help it. She does exasperate me so. She
doesn&#8217;t show a proper deference for your husband,
my dear. We are married now, and she
ought to give up her objections to me. I can&#8217;t be
expected to place myself in her leading strings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you mustn&#8217;t demand too much at once,
and should try to conciliate her. Now do, for my
sake; won&#8217;t you, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Here we were, only a month married, and
spending our honeymoon at a most charming
summer resort, where there was no excuse for
getting out of patience. Everything was beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>and attractive: Little hotel, strange to say,
quite delightful; no fault to find with surroundings
and accommodations; my darling Bessie,
as sweet as an angel and determined to be happy
and to make me happy; everything, in short,
calculated to give us a long summer of delight.</p>

<p>That is, if Bessie had only been an orphan.
But there was her mother, who had joined us
on our summer trip, after the first two weeks of
unalloyed happiness, and threatened to accompany
us through life. Already it almost made
the prospect dismal. The idea that Bessie and
I would ever quarrel, or even have any impatient
words together, had seemed to me to be simply
ridiculous. I had seen what I had seen. My
dashing friend, Fred, and his stylish wife,&mdash;they
had been married two years, and a visible coldness
had come upon them. I knew, by an occasional
angry whisper and knitting of the brow before
people, that he must sometimes swear and rave in
the privacy of their own rooms, and her cutting
replies or haughty indifference showed that there
had been a deal of love lost between them in those
two years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>Other people, too, got indifferent or downright
hostile in their marital relations. But then, I was
not a dashing fellow and Bessie was not stylish,
and in other ways we were quite different from
most people. Ours had been a real love-match
from the first. Bessie was simple and unaffected,
honest and pure in every thought, and determined
to make me a faithful and loving wife till death
did us part. As for me, why, of course I was generous
and affectionate, ready to make any sacrifice
and bear any burden for the trusting creature who
had so freely given herself into my keeping.
There should be no clouds to darken her life. I
would never be selfish or impatient, or for one
moment hurt her gentle heart by heedless act or
careless word.</p>

<p>But plague upon it! I could not get on with her
mother; and here I was, before our summer holiday
was over, and before we had settled down
to that home life in which trouble and annoyance
must needs come, getting out of patience and saying
cruel things; and there was Bessie, sitting in
the summer twilight with a light shawl drawn over
her shoulders, pouting her pretty lips with vexation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>and digging the toes of her little boots into
the balustrade in front of us, because I had expressed
a pious wish that her mother was in Jericho.
I declare, if there weren&#8217;t tears gathering
in her gentle blue eyes!</p>

<p>I was angry with myself, and, putting my arm
around her slender waist, I laid my cheek against
hers and said soothingly, &#8220;Never mind, darling! I
didn&#8217;t mean it. Don&#8217;t think any more about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But as we sat for the next five minutes without
saying a word, I couldn&#8217;t help pondering on the
possibilities of the future, for Mrs. Pinkerton was
to live with us. That was one of the understood
conditions of our bargain, and it was evident that
she was to furnish the test of all my good resolutions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pinkerton had been left a widow when
Bessie was twelve years old, with a neat little cottage
in the suburbs of the city and a snug competence
in a secure investment. I was fairly settled
in business, with an income that would enable us
to live in modest comfort, and was determined
not to disturb the investment or have it drawn
upon in any way for household expenses. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>the old lady&mdash;I already began to speak of her by
that disrespectful epithet, although she was still
under fifty&mdash;was to live with us. I had readily
acquiesced in that arrangement, for was it not my
darling&#8217;s wish? And I could not decently make
any objection, for it was mighty convenient to
have a pretty cottage, ready furnished, in one of
the finest suburbs of the city in which I was employed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pinkerton was a good woman in her way:
how could she be anything else and the mother of
such an angel as I had secured for my wife? She
meant well, of course; I admitted that, and I
ought to be on the pleasantest terms with her, and
determined from the first that I would be. But
somehow we were not congenial, and when that
is the case the best people in the world find it
hard to get along agreeably together.</p>

<p>The course of true love between Bessie and me
had run very smooth. From the moment my old
school-fellow, her brother George, now in Paris
studying medicine, had introduced me to her, I
had been completely won by her sweet disposition
and charming ways, and she in turn was captivated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>by my manly independence, strong good sense,
and generous impulses. I am not vain, but the
truth is the truth; and, as I am telling this story
myself, I must set down the facts. We fell in love
right away, and it was not long before we were
mutually convinced that we were made expressly
for each other and could never be happy apart.</p>

<p>So it happened that I had to do the courting
with the mother. She was the one to be won
over, and it was not likely to be an easy task,
for I plainly saw that she did not quite approve of
me. When I was first introduced to her, she
looked at me with her great, steady blue eyes, as
if analyzing me to the very boots, and evidently
set me down as a somewhat arrogant and self-sufficient
young fellow who needed a judicious
course of discipline to teach him humility. I was
generally self-possessed and had no little confidence
in myself, but I confess that I was embarrassed in
her presence. She was not at all like Bessie, I
thought. She had taught school in her youth, and
had learned to command and be obeyed. The
late Mr. Pinkerton, I fancied, had found it useless
to contend against her authority, and this had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>increased her disposition to carry things her
own way; and her seven years&#8217; widowhood,
with its independence and self-reliance, had not
prepared her to be submissive to the wishes of
others.</p>

<p>Still, she loved her daughter with tender devotion,
and her chief anxiety was to have her every
wish gratified. Therein was my advantage, for I
knew that Bessie, gentle and trusting as she was,
would never give me up or allow her life to be
happy without the gratification of her first love.
So I set to work confidently to make myself
agreeable to the widow and win her consent to
our marriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must bring mamma around to approve of
it,&#8221; Bessie had said, on that ever-to-be-remembered
evening, when we were returning from a
long drive, and after an hour of sweet confidences
she had surrendered herself without reserve to
my future keeping. &#8220;She is the best mother in the
world, and loves me very much, but she is peculiar
in some ways, and I am afraid she doesn&#8217;t
altogether like you. I would not for the world
displease her, that is, if I could help it,&#8221; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>added, glancing up, as much as to say, &#8220;It is all
settled now forever and forevermore, whatever
may befall, but do get my mother to consent to it
with a good grace.&#8221;</p>

<span class="caption">COURTING THE MOTHER.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">M</span>rs. Pinkerton</span> sat in an easy-chair near
the window, doing nothing, when I marched
in to begin the siege. I felt diffident and uneasy,
although I am not usually troubled that
way. But if I should live to the advanced age of
Methusaleh, I could never forget Mrs. Pinkerton&#8217;s
appearance on that memorable occasion. Before
I had spoken a word I saw that she knew what
was coming, and had hardened her heart against
me. She had anticipated all that I would say,
had discounted my plea, as it were, and prejudged
the whole case. Her look plainly said: &#8220;Young
man, I know your pitiful story. You needn&#8217;t
tell me. You may be very well as young men go,
you fancy you can more than fill a mother&#8217;s place
in Bessie&#8217;s inexperienced heart, but you can&#8217;t get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>me out. I am Adamant. Your intentions are all
very honorable, but you are a graceless intruder.
Your credentials are rejected on sight.&#8221; I saw the
difficult task I had undertaken. &#8220;Mrs. Pinkerton,&#8221;
I said, mustering all my forces, &#8220;it is no use
mincing the matter, or beating about the shrubbery.
I am in love with your daughter, and
Bessie is in love with me. I believe I can make
Bessie happy, and am sure nothing but Bessie can
make me happy. I have come to ask your consent
to our marriage.&#8221; Then I hung my head like
a whipped school-boy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pinkerton took off her eye-glasses, and
then put them on again with considerable care;
after which she leveled a look at me and through
me that made me feel like calling out &#8220;Murder!&#8221;
or making for the door. But I stood my ground,
and heard her say quietly,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are engaged to my daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>A simple remark, but the tone meant &#8220;You are
a puppy.&#8221; I had to muster all my resolution to
reply politely and coolly that, with her gracious
consent, such was the fact.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you aware that it is customary to obtain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>parental consent before proceeding to such
lengths?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Pinkerton, excuse me. I thought in my
ignorance that it would be just as well to do that
afterwards; or rather, I didn&#8217;t think anything
about it. I was so much in love with Bessie that it
was all out before I knew it. If I had thought,
of course I would have&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Pinkerton, &#8220;if your kind
of people ever thought, they would undoubtedly
do differently. Bessie certainly ought to know
better. Girls rush into matrimony now-a-days
with as much carelessness as they would choose
partners at a game of croquet. I should have
been consulted in this. It is all wrong to allow
young people to have such entire freedom in affairs
of this kind as they are allowed in these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But certainly, my dear Mrs. Pinkerton,&#8221; I
said, becoming somewhat impatient, &#8220;you will
not refuse your consent in this case? Bessie&#8217;s
happiness&mdash;that is, the happiness of all of us, or&mdash;our
happiness&mdash;Bessie&#8217;s and mine, I would
say&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt your happiness is very important to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>yourself, Mr. Travers, and as to my daughter&#8217;s
well-being, I have looked to that for quite a number
of years past, and I flatter myself I shall be
able to look out for it in the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if you insist on parting us!&#8221; I cried, getting
out of patience and letting all my carefully
prepared plans of assault go by the board. &#8220;You
may withhold your consent, but that cannot prevent
our loving each other!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. Nothing on earth can prevent
young people who are in love from making themselves
ridiculous. But getting married and living
together soon cures them of sentimentalism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you give us that chance to be cured
then, my dear Mrs. Pinkerton?&#8221; I exclaimed, regaining
a little tact.</p>

<p>She seemed to be taking it under advisement,
and my courage came up a little. Then, looking
at me with her peculiarly searching gaze, she said,
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t necessary to argue the case; I know
all you would say. You love Bessie to distraction;
you could not live without her; your heart
would be hopelessly broken if you had to give
her up; you will be true to her forever and a day;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>you offer her all of the good things of this world
that any sane woman could desire, besides which
you throw in an eternal, undying devotion; and
so on, to the end of the chapter. We will consider
that all said, and so save time and trouble.
You think that ought to end the matter and bring
me to your way of thinking. I wonder at the effrontery
of young men, who walk into our households
and carelessly tell us mothers what is best
for our children, and assure us, between their
puffs of tobacco smoke, that a case of three weeks&#8217;
moonshining outweighs the devotion of a lifetime.&#8221;</p>

<p>I began to see what course was open for me.
The old lady was jealous, and I could not blame
her. Her objections were general, not specific.
Strategy must take the place of a direct assault.
There flashed through my mind the ridiculous old
nonsense rhyme quotation,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;I must soften the heart of this terrible cow.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I said gently, &#8220;I can readily see how a mother
must regard the claims of the man who comes to
her demanding her most precious treasure; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>what you say makes me feel how presumptuous my
demand must seem. I love your daughter&mdash;that
must be my only excuse. And after all, what has
happened was only what a mother must expect.
Your daughter&#8217;s love will not be the less yours
because she also loves the man of her choice. That
she should love and be loved was inevitable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will not go into the discussion any further,&#8221;
she interrupted. &#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to say anything
uncomplimentary of you personally, but I
simply am not prepared to give my daughter up
at present. My opinion of men in general is
good, so long as they do not interfere with me or
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>(Mental note: &#8220;May there be precious little
interference between us!&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;Your judgment is doubtless good,&#8221; I said,
smiling; &#8220;but there are exceptions which prove
the rule, and I hope you will find that even I will
improve upon acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your conceit is abominable, young man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. I have found no one who could
flatter me except myself, so I lose no opportunity
to give myself a good character.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>&#8220;Especially in addressing the mother of the
woman you wish to marry, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely, as she is naturally prejudiced against
me. My dear Mrs. Pinkerton, what must I do to
please you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything but that. You admit that I am a
good fellow enough, and that Bessie would probably
marry some one in course of time. Now, I
don&#8217;t see why you cannot make us both happy by
giving your consent. It costs you a pang to do it.
I honor you for that. Give me the right to console
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By making myself an object of pity? No,
not yet, not yet. I must, at least, have time to
think.&#8221;</p>

<p>I inwardly cursed my luck. How long was
this sort of thing going to last? I was about to
rise and take my leave, when an inspiration
struck me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Pinkerton,&#8221; I said gravely, &#8220;what you
have said of the ties that exist between you and
your daughter has touched me deeply. I believe
we young people do not half appreciate a mother&#8217;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>unchanging love. It lies so far beneath the surface
that we are too apt to forget its constant
blessing. My mother died when I was very
young. Ah, if she were only here now, to plead
my cause for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>With these words, I turned on my heel and
hastily got out of the room. I went into the
garden and lighted a cigar, the better to think
over the situation. I could not determine what
progress, if any, I had made in the good graces
of Mrs. Pinkerton. While I was cogitating,
Bessie came out and approached me with an
inquiring look. I am afraid my returning glance
did not greatly reassure her. As she came up
and took my arm, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! No, it&#8217;s not very well. I am beaten,
my dear. Your mother is simply a stony-hearted
parent!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did she say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she wants you to grow up an old maid&mdash;as
if such a thing were possible!&mdash;and says that
lovers have no idea of what a mean, cruel thing it
is to rob people of only daughters; and that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>shall require time to think of it. What do you
think of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie knitted her pretty brows, and dug her
toes into the walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I had better go to her?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you must. But I know it won&#8217;t be
of any use just yet. We must, as she says, give her
time. She will come around all right at the end
of nine or ten years. The fact is, Bessie, she&#8217;s
a little bit jealous of me and regards me as an
intruder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor, dear mamma!&#8221; said Bessie, her eyes
becoming moist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor, dear pussy-cat! You should have seen
her shoot me with her eyes and ridicule my honest
sentiment. She used me roughly, my dear, and I
can&#8217;t help wondering at my amazing politeness to
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie was not discouraged. She had several
interviews with her mother, in which protestations,
tears, smiles, and coaxings played a part, but
there was no apparent change of heart on the part
of the old lady, after all. I don&#8217;t know how long
this disagreeable state of affairs would have continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>under ordinary circumstances, had not an
unexpected, thrilling, and, as it happened, fortunate
occurrence hastened a crisis and brought an
end to the siege. It was a very singular thing,
and it seemed to have been pre-arranged to bring
me glory, and, what was better, the desired goodwill
of the &#8220;stony-hearted parent.&#8221;</p>

<p>If there was any one thing that the worthy Mrs.
Pinkerton detested more than men and tobacco,
that thing was a burglar. Add fear to detestation,
and you will see that when I defended the
old lady from the attentions of a burglar, I had
taken a long step into her good graces.</p>

<p>It was a week after the interview narrated above,
and in the early summer, Mrs. Pinkerton had gone
down to a quiet sea-side resort for a short stay,
thinking to get away from me; but I was not to
be put off so. I followed her, taking a room at
the same hotel.</p>

<p>About one o&#8217;clock at night, the particular burglar
to whom I owe so much, effected an entrance
into the hotel through a basement window, and
quietly made his way up stairs. Every one was
asleep except myself, and I was planning all sorts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>of expedients to conquer the prejudices of my
mother-in-law that was to be. Mrs. Pinkerton&#8217;s
room opened on a long corridor, near the end of
which my modest seven-by-nine snuggery was situated.
It was a warm night, and the transoms
over the doors of almost all the bed-chambers had
been left open to admit the air. A gleam of light
from a dark-lantern, coming through my transom,
was what led me to hastily don a pair of trousers
and take my revolver from my valise. Then I
opened my door very cautiously, without having
struck a light, and could see&mdash;nothing! I waited
a few moments, almost holding my breath. At
the end of those few moments I could make out
the form of a man swarming over the top of the
door of Mrs. Pinkerton&#8217;s room. His head and
shoulders were already inside the room, and I
could see his legs wriggle about as he noiselessly
wormed his way through the narrow transom. It
took me but a brief second of time to glide forward
on tiptoe and mount the same chair which
had been used by the intruder in climbing to the
transom. This done, I seized both the wriggling
legs simultaneously, and gave a tremendous pull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>My excitement must have imbued me with
double my natural strength, and the result of that
pull was simply indescribable. Burglar, transom-glass,
chair and all, went in a heap on the floor of
the corridor, producing the most appalling and
unearthly racket conceivable. The whole house
was in an uproar in a moment. People seemed to
spring up from every square foot of floor in the corridor
as if by magic. Cries of &#8220;Fire!&#8221; &#8220;Murder!&#8221;
&#8220;Help!&#8221; and screams of frightened women, rose
on every hand. The costumes which I beheld on
that momentous occasion were not only varied but
exceedingly amusing and picturesque as well.
The assembled multitude found nothing to interest
them, however. I alone was to be seen, seated on
a broken chair, with a rapidly swelling black eye,
while broken glass and an extinguished lantern lay
on the floor. I told the male guests what had happened.
The burglar had not waited to ask for my
card, but had contented himself with planting one
blow from the shoulder on my left eye, before I
could get upon my legs. And my revolver.
Well, I had not had the ghost of a chance to use
it. It was in my pocket. Fifteen minutes after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>the fracas, Mrs. Pinkerton came to my room, completely
dressed, and insisted upon coming in to hear
all about it and to overwhelm me with thanks and
admiration. I was as modest as heroes proverbially
are, and then and there told her never to refer
to the subject again unless she addressed me as
Bessie&#8217;s betrothed.</p>

<p>We went riding together, Bessie, Mrs. Pinkerton,
and I, the day after this episode; and without
any previous indication of an approaching
thaw, that singular old lady began to talk freely
about what should be worn at &#8220;the wedding,&#8221;
referring to it as though she had been the principal
agent in bringing it about.</p>

<span class="caption">OUR MARRIAGE.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">S</span>o</span> it was that I brought my darling&#8217;s mother
around to consent, if not with a very good
grace, still with apparent cheerfulness, and she at
once took the direction of the nuptial preparations.
I made a show of consulting her about
many things, but she invariably gave me to understand
that her experience and superior knowledge
in such matters were not to be gainsaid. I was willing
to leave to her all the fuss and frippery of preparing
clothes for her daughter. It always seemed
to me that she had clothes enough, and clothes
that were good enough for married life. I couldn&#8217;t
understand why a young woman, on becoming a
wife, should need a lot of new and elaborate dresses,
such as she had never worn and never cared to
wear, and an endless variety of under-garments
of mysterious and incomprehensible make, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>frills and fringes and laces and edgings, as if, up
to that time, she had never had anything next to
her precious person, except what was visible to the
exterior world. And even assuming that she
donned these things for the first time as parts of
a manifold and complicated wedding garment, why
should so much fine needle-work and delicate
trimming be prepared to be stowed away out of
sight of prying mortals, for whose vision women
are presumed to dress themselves? Are they got
up to show to friends and excite envy, and to fill
the minds of other young people with a sense of
the difficulties of getting married?</p>

<p>One day, when I happened in,&mdash;by accident,
of course,&mdash;and the mother happened
to be out on one of her many pilgrimages
to town, Bessie took me up to her room in
a half-frightened way, as if doing something
that she was afraid was terribly improper, and
showed me a bewildering profusion of these
things, neatly tucked away in bureau drawers.
I laughed outright, and asked her who was to see
all that finery. She was vexed and bit her lip,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>and I was sorry and voted myself a brute. From
that moment, I determined not to say a word
about the clothes, except to express unstinted
admiration.</p>

<p>There was not only clothing, but blankets and
quilts and bed linen, though we were to live in
her old home, which was already well supplied.
One would suppose that a large and sudden
increase of family was expected at once. These
things annoyed me as senseless, and as absorbing
so much of my Bessie&#8217;s attention that we didn&#8217;t
have half the blissful times together that we had
before our engagement was an acknowledged
thing. But I knew that it was the mother&#8217;s
doings. Bessie did not really have any foolish
care for dress, though always beautifully arrayed
without any apparent effort; but she supposed it
was the proper thing, and submitted to her
mother.</p>

<p>But there was one thing I set my heart on. I
wanted a quiet wedding, without display or pretence.
It did seem to me that this was a private
occasion in which the wishes of the persons chiefly
concerned should be consulted. It was their business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>and should be conducted in their own way.
Bessie sympathized with me, and wanted of all
things to go to church quietly and privately, and
then, after a leave-taking with a few intimate
friends at home, start right off on our proposed trip
to the White Mountains. But no; we were inexperienced,
and the widow knew what the occasion
demanded much better than we did. She was a
little grand in her ideas, and felt the importance of
keeping on good terms with society. I was disposed
to apply profane epithets to society, and to
insist that this marriage was mine and Bessie&#8217;s, and
nobody&#8217;s else. But what was the use? There would
be unpleasant feelings, and the mamma must be conciliated,
and so I yielded after a warm but altogether
affectionate little controversy with Bessie.</p>

<p>Every time I came to the house now, I was
informed of some new feature which Mrs. P. had
decided upon as indispensable to the gorgeousness
of the occasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ordered your dress suit yet?&#8221; she
asked one evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dress suit? Oh yes. I had almost forgotten
that.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>&#8220;And, by the way, those cards? I think you
had better send them out: you write such a good,
legible hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-e-s, oh yes. With pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you go to the city to-morrow, I wish
you would drop in at Draper&#8217;s and get me a few
little things. I have made out a list, so it won&#8217;t
be any trouble to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No trouble at all. Glad to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That white ribbon should be medium width.
And before I forget it, have you written yet to
your friend De Forest about his standing up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I forgot it. I&#8217;ll drop him a line to-morrow.
But what do you want that ribbon to be so long for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is to be held across the aisle by the
ushers, you know, to keep off the <i>ignobile vulgus</i>.
You and Bessie will march up <i>here</i>, you see,
preceded by the four ushers and the bridesmaids
and groomsmen, who will then range themselves
off this way. The members of the families and
the friends will be separated from the other people
<i>thus</i>. It&#8217;s very pretty. Belle Graham was
married that way at St. Thomas&#8217;s, and everybody
said it was splendid.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>This is the kind of talk I had to listen to for
weeks, and is it any wonder that I grew thin and
had sleepless nights?</p>

<p>I was now a mere puppet in the hands of Mrs.
Pinkerton, and came and went as she pulled the
wires. She had arranged that the affair was to
take place in &#8220;her church&#8221;&mdash;and a very fashionable
temple of worship it was. Her rector was to
officiate, assisted by the vealy young man who had
just graduated from the theological seminary.
There were to be four bridesmaids and an equal
number of groomsmen and of ushers. I should have
liked to have something to say about who should
&#8220;stand up&#8221; with us, as Mrs. Pinkerton expressed
it; but when I timidly suggested that some of my
friends would be available for the purpose, I was
taken aback to learn that the entire list had been
made up and decided upon without my knowledge,
and that only one of the groomsmen chosen was a
friend of mine,&mdash;De Forest,&mdash;the others being
young men whom the worthy Mrs. Pinkerton had
selected from her list of society people. One of
the young men was a downright fool, if I must call
things by their right names, but he dressed to perfection;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>the remaining two I scarcely knew by
sight, but I did know that one of them had seen
the time when he aspired to occupy the place I
was now filling in respect to the Pinkerton household:
need I say more concerning my sentiments
regarding him?</p>

<p>The ushers,&mdash;well, of course, they were the
four young gentlemen who knew everybody who
was anybody, and I could not object to them,
considering that they charged nothing for their
onerous services.</p>

<p>The bridesmaids were all old school friends of
Bessie&#8217;s, and two of them were considered pretty,
and the other two were stylish.</p>

<p>One of my keenest regrets was that Bessie&#8217;s
brother George was away off in Paris, and could
not grace the occasion with his superb presence;
for he was a superb fellow in all respects, and I
felt a true brotherly affection for him. Had he
not introduced me to Bessie? Had he not always
wanted me to become his brother-in-law?</p>

<p>The great day came at last. The town was full
of the invited people, and the weather, so anxiously
looked to on such occasions, was all that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>could be desired. My remembrance of the solemn
events of that day is now rather misty. I
remember the tussle De Forest and I had with my
collar and cravat in the morning, and how he
stuck pins into my neck, and wrestled mightily
with his own elaborate toilet. I remember, and
this very distinctly, how awfully tight were my
new patent-leather boots, which caused me for the
time being the most excruciating anguish. Beyond
these, and similar minor things which have a way
of sticking in the memory, all the rest is very
much like a vivid dream. The close carriage
whirling through the streets; a great crush of
people, with here and there a familiar, smiling
face; Bessie in her wedding-dress of white silk,
with her long veil and twining garlands of orange
blossoms; the bridesmaids, radiant in tarletan,
with pretty blue bows and sashes; the long aisle,
up which we marched with slow and reverent
tread; the pealing measures of the Wedding Chorus;
the dignified and fatherly clergyman; the
vealy young assistant; the unction of the slowly
intoned words of the marriage-service; the fumbling
for the ring,&mdash;and through it all there rises,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>as out of a mist, the face of my mother-in-law, the
presiding genius of it all, the unknown quantity in
the equation of my married life, now begun amid
the felicitations, more or less sincere, of a host of
kissing, hand-shaking, smiling, chattering, good-natured
aunts, uncles, cousins, and relatives of all
degrees.</p>

<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">S</span>o</span> the bells were rung, metaphorically speaking,
and we were wed. I had a long leave
of absence from the banking-house in which I
held a responsible and confidential position, and
we started for the mountains, leaving mamma
Pinkerton to put things to rights and follow us in
a fortnight, when we had decided to settle down
for a month&#8217;s quiet stay in a picturesque town of
the mountain region. Oh, the unrestrained joy of
that fortnight! Everybody at the hotels seemed
to know by instinct that we were a newly-married
pair, and knowing glances passed between them.
But what did we care? With pride and a conscious
embarrassment that made my hand tremble,
I wrote on the registers in a bold hand &#8220;Charles
Travers and wife.&#8221; I asked for the best room
with a pleasant out-look. The smiling clerk,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>trained to dissimulation, would appear as unconscious
as the blank safe behind him, but he knew
all the while, the sly rascal, that we were on a
wedding trip, and he paid special attention to our
comfort. We saw the glories and wonders of the
mountains, and shared their inspiration as with a
single heart. We rose early to drink the clear air
and greet the rising sun together. We strolled
out in the evening to romantic spots, and there,
with arms around each other, as we walked or
stood gazing on the scene and listening to the
rustling breeze, we were happy. For two weeks
our lives blended with each other and with nature,
and it was with a sigh that we mounted the lumbering
stage to take up our sojourn in the retired
town on the hills. We came to the little hotel
just at night, and were stared at and commented
upon by those who had been there three days and
assumed the air of having had possession for years.
We were tired, and kept aloof that evening, and
the next day mother-in-law arrived.</p>

<p>As she dismounted from the coach, she gave the
driver a severe warning to be careful of her trunk,
an iron-bound treasure that would have defied the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>efforts of the most determined baggage-smasher.
Bessie had flown to meet her, and their greeting was
affectionate; but to me the old lady presented a
hand encased in a mitt, or sort of glove with amputated
fingers, and gave me a stately, &#8220;I hope you
are well, sir,&#8221; that rather made me feel sick. She
looked full at me in her steady and commanding
way, as much as to say, &#8220;Well, you have committed
no atrocious crime yet, I suppose; but I
am rather surprised at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>If there is anything I pride myself on, it is self-possession
and a willingness to face anybody and
give as good as I get, but that magnificently imperious
way of looking with those large eyes
always disconcerted me. I could not brace myself
enough to meet them with any show of impudence,
though the old lady had not ceased to
regard that as the chief trait of my character. As
Mrs. Pinkerton trod with stately step the rude
piazza of that summer hotel, she put her eye-glasses
on and surveyed its occupants with a look that
made them shrink into themselves and feel ashamed
to be sitting about in that idle way. I believe the
old lady&#8217;s eyesight was good enough, and that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>used her glasses, with their gold bows and the
slender chain with which they were suspended
about her neck, for effect. I noticed that if they
were not on she always put them on to look at
anything, and if they happened to be on she took
them off for the same purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, going into the little parlor, and
looking from the windows, &#8220;this really seems to be
a fine situation. The view of the mountains is quite
grand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very kind of you to approve of the mountains,
but you could give them points on grandeur,&#8221;
I thought; but I merely remarked, &#8220;We find it
quite pleasant here.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned and glanced at me without reply,
as much as to say, &#8220;Who addressed you, sir?
You would do well to speak when you are spoken
to.&#8221; I was abashed, but was determined to do
the agreeable so far as I could, in spite of the
rebuke of those eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The house doesn&#8217;t seem to me to be very attractive,&#8221;
she continued, glancing around with a gaze
that took in everything through all the partition
walls, and assuming a tone that meant, &#8220;I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>speaking to you, Bessie, and no one else.&#8221; &#8220;What
sort of people are there here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, some very pleasant people, I should
judge,&#8221; said Bessie, &#8220;but we have been here only
one day, you know, and have made no acquaintances
to speak of. Charlie&#8217;s friend, Fred Marston,
from the city, is here with his wife; and I
met a young lady to whom I took quite a fancy
this morning, a Miss Van Duzen. She is quite
wealthy, and an orphan, and is here with her
uncle, a fine-looking gentleman, who is president
of a bank, or an insurance company, or some
thing of the sort. You saw him, I think, on the
piazza,&mdash;the large man, with gray side-whiskers,
white vest, and heavy gold chain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I noticed him. A pompous-looking old
gentleman, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he is dignified in his manner, but not at
all pompous,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I call him pompous, if looks mean anything,&#8221;
said the mother, with the air of one to
whom looks were quite sufficient. &#8220;I think I
will go to my room,&#8221; she added, and turned a
glance on me, as much as to say, &#8220;You needn&#8217;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>come, sir.&#8221; I had no intention of going, and
wandered out on the piazza, feeling as though
Bessie had almost been taken away from me
again.</p>

<p>When she rejoined me, leaving her mother
above stairs, I asked, &#8220;What does she think of
her room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it doesn&#8217;t quite suit her. She thinks
the furniture scanty and shabby, water scarce,
towels rather coarse, and she can&#8217;t endure the
sight of a kerosene lamp; but she will make herself
quite comfortable, I dare say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And everybody else uncomfortable,&#8221; I felt
like adding, but restrained myself.</p>

<p>She came down to tea, and being offered a seat
on the other side of me from Bessie, firmly declined
it, and took the one on the other side of her
daughter from me. As she unfolded her napkin
she took in the whole table with a searching glance,
and had formed a quick estimate of everybody
sitting around it. Miss Clara Van Duzen and Mr.
Desmond, her uncle, sat opposite, and an introduction
across the table took place. The young lady
was vivacious and talkative, and tried to make herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>agreeable, but my mother-in-law did not like
what she afterwards called her &#8220;chatter,&#8221; and set
her down as a frivolous young person. &#8220;Miss
Van,&#8221; as everybody called her, with her own approval,&mdash;for,
as she said, she detested the Duzen
which her Dutch ancestors had bequeathed her with
their other property,&mdash;was of New York Knickerbocker
origin, now living with her uncle in Boston,
and was by no means frivolous, though uncommonly
lively. She had fine, brown eyes, beautiful
hair, and a complexion that defied sun and wind.
It had the rosy glow of health, and indicated a
good digestion and high spirits. Mr. Desmond
seemed to be mostly white vest, immaculate shirt-front,
and gold chain, the last-named article being
very heavy and meandering through the button-holes
of his vest and up around his invisible neck.
He said little, and was evidently not much given
to light conversation. He was very gracious in his
attentions to the ladies, however, and seemed to
pay special deference to Mrs. Pinkerton. I afterwards
learned that he was a widower of long standing,
without chick or child, and the guardian of his
niece, whom he regarded with great admiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>Down at the other end of the table was Marston,
evidently giving vent to his impatience
about something, and his wife, with fierce eyes,
telling him, in manner if not in words, not to
make a fool of himself. The rest of the company
was made up either of transient visitors or
of persons with whom this story has nothing in
particular to do.</p>

<p>As we emerged on the piazza after tea, Fred,
who had impolitely gone out in advance, called
out, &#8220;Charlie, old boy, come over here and have
a smoke!&#8221;</p>

<p>I must confess that these long sittings on the
piazzas of summer hotels had lured me back to
my old habits, which I had forsworn in my efforts
to conciliate Bessie&#8217;s mother. Bessie had
encouraged me in it, for to tell the truth she
rather liked the fragrance of a good cigar, and
dearly loved to see me enjoying it. It was my
nature to defy the whole world and be master of
my own habits, but I had felt a mean inclination,
after mother-in-law joined the party, to slink away
and smoke on the sly. There was nothing for it
now, however, but to put on a bold face, or play
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>the hypocrite and pretend I didn&#8217;t smoke. The
latter I would not do, and if I had attempted it,
it wouldn&#8217;t go down with Fred, and I should have
been in a worse predicament than ever. I went
boldly across the piazza and took the proffered
cigar. Glancing out at the corner of my eye as
I was lighting it, I saw my mother-in-law regarding
me through her glasses with increased disfavor.
She did not, however, seem to be surprised,
and doubtless believed me capable of any perfidy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Charlie, old boy, let&#8217;s have a game of
billiards,&#8221; said Fred, after a few puffs. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give
you twenty points and beat you out of your boots.&#8221;
Now I was very fond of billiards, and usually
didn&#8217;t care who knew it, but Mrs. Pinkerton did
not approve of the game, and had no knowledge
that I indulged in it. But Fred would speak in
that absurd shouting way of his, and all the ladies
heard him. Again I mustered up resolution and
went into the billiard room, but I played very
indifferently, and was thinking all the time of my
mother-in-law and her opinion of me. I really
wanted to get into her good graces, but it required
the sacrifice of all my own inclinations, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>despised a man who deliberately played the hypocrite
to win anybody&#8217;s favor.</p>

<p>After two or three listless games I said to Fred,
&#8220;I guess I will join the ladies.&#8221; I was feeling
some qualms of conscience for staying away from
Bessie a whole hour at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hang the ladies!&#8221; was Fred&#8217;s graceless
response; &#8220;they can take care of themselves. My
wife gets along well enough without me, I know,
and yours will soon learn to be quite comfortable
without your guardian presence; besides she&#8217;s got
her mother now. By the way, what a mighty
grand old dowager Mrs. Pink is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pinkerton is her name,&#8221; I said, a little haughtily,
as if resenting the liberty he took with my
mother-in-law&#8217;s cognomen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I know, but the name is too long; and
besides, she reminds one of a full-blown pink, a
little on the fade, perhaps, but still with a good
deal of bloom about her. Is she going to live
with you? Precious fine time you will have!&#8221; he
added, having received his answer by a nod.
&#8220;She&#8217;ll boss the shebang, you bet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess not,&#8221; I answered, not liking his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>slangy way of talking about my affairs, and resolving
in my own mind that I would be master in
my own house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then there&#8217;ll be a fine old tussle for
supremacy, and don&#8217;t you forget it!&#8221;</p>

<p>With this remark Fred wandered off down the
dusty road, humming Madame Angot, and I drew
up a chair by Bessie&#8217;s side. She had evidently
been wishing I would come. Mr. Desmond was
sitting a little apart from the rest, twisting his
fingers in his watch-chain and looking intently at
the mountain-top opposite, as if expecting somebody
to come over with a dispatch for him. Mrs.
Pinkerton sat by her daughter&#8217;s side in calm
grandeur, her gray puffs&mdash;that fine silver-gray
that comes prematurely on aristocratic brows&mdash;seeming
like appendages of a queenly diadem.
Miss Van had been diverting the company with a
lively account of her day&#8217;s adventures. She was
always having adventures, and had a faculty of
relating them that was little short of genius.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my dear, are you having a good time?&#8221;
I murmured in Bessie&#8217;s ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; but I was feeling a little lonesome
without you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>The conversation degenerated into commonplace
about the scenery and points of interest in
the neighborhood, and after a while the company
dispersed with polite good-evenings.</p>

<p>When we reached our room, I remarked to
Bessie, who seemed more quiet than usual, &#8220;I
hope your mother will like it here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I guess she will like it when she has
been here a little while,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;You
know she has not been away from home much, of
late years, except to the seaside with the Watsons
and other of her old friends, and she does not
adapt herself readily to strange company.&#8221;</p>

<p>I said nothing more, but was absorbed in
thought about my mother-in-law. It is evident
by this time that she was no ordinary woman, no
coarse or waspish mother-in-law, but a woman of
good breeding and the highest character. She
was intelligent and well-informed, a consistent
member of the Episcopal Church, with the highest
views of propriety and a reverential regard for
the rules of conduct laid down by good society.
This made her all the harder to deal with. If she
were a common or vulgar sort of mother-in-law,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>I could assert my prerogatives without compunction;
and I was forced to admit that she was a
very worthy woman, and not given to petty
meddling, but I felt that her presence was an
awful restraint. Without her we could have such
good times, going and coming as we pleased, and
acting with entire freedom; but she must be
counted in, and was a factor that materially
affected the result. She could not be ignored;
her opinions could not be disregarded. That
would be rude, and besides, their influence would
make itself felt. Strange, the irresistible effect of
a presence upon one! She might not openly interfere
or directly oppose, but there she was, and
she didn&#8217;t approve of me or like my friends,
could not fall in with my ways or my wishes, and
make one of any company in which I should feel
at ease, and I knew that her presence would be
depressing, and spoil our summer&#8217;s pleasure; and
after that was over and we were at home, what?
Well, sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
We slept the sound sleep that mountain and
country quiet brings, and took the chances of the
future.</p>

<span class="caption">THE RISE AND FALL.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">D</span>uring</span> the next week of our stay at the
Fairview hotel, it grew rather dull. There
was little to do but drive on the long country
roads, or wander over the hills and in the fields
and woods. I could have found plenty of pleasure
in that with Bessie and a party of congenial
friends, but it didn&#8217;t seem to be right always to
leave my worthy mother-in-law behind, with her
crochet work or the last new novel from the city,
on the sunny piazza or in her dim little chamber.
She was not averse to drives, in fact enjoyed them
very much, but she seemed to divine that I did
not really want her company, though I protested,
as became a dutiful son-in-law, that I should be
very glad to take her at any time. She did go
with us once or twice, but the laughter and romping
behavior which gave our rides their chief zest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>were extinguished, and we jogged along in the
most proper manner, professing admiration for the
outlines of the hills and the far-away stretches of
scenery between the more distant mountains. We
returned as quiet and demure as if we had been to
a funeral. Mrs. Pinkerton saw the effect, and with
her fine feeling of independence, she politely but
firmly declined to go afterwards. As for walking
on anything but level sidewalks or gravel-paths,
she could not think of such a thing. The idea of
her climbing a hill or getting herself over a fence
seemed ridiculous to anybody that knew her.</p>

<p>So it was that we were continually forced to
leave her behind, or deny ourselves the chief recreation
of the country. I was sincerely disinclined
to slight her in any way, and desirous of
contributing to her pleasure, but what could I do?
A fellow can&#8217;t get an iceberg to enjoy tropical sunshine.
Our dislike to leave the old lady alone,
although she insisted that she didn&#8217;t mind it at
all, led us to pass a large portion of each day,
sometimes all day, about the house. It was
&#8220;deuced stupid,&#8221; to use Marston&#8217;s elegant phrase,
but there was little to do for it. To be sure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>there was Desmond, &#8220;old Dives,&#8221; Fred called him.
He seldom went out of sight of the house, but he
had a perfect mail-bag of newspapers and letters
every morning, and spent the forenoon indoors,
holding sweet communion with them and answering
his correspondents. In the afternoon he sat
on the piazza by the hour, contemplating the
mountain-top that had such a fascination for him.
He had a prodigious amount of information on
all manner of subjects, and a quick and accurate
judgment; but he was generally very reticent,
as he tipped back in his chair and twisted his
fingers in and out of that fine gold chain. My
mother-in-law, from her shady nook of the piazza,
would glance at him occasionally from her work
or her book, as much as to say, &#8220;It is strange
people can&#8217;t make some effort to be agreeable,
instead of being so stiff and dignified all the
afternoon&#8221;; but he seemed unconscious of her
looks and her mental comments. His thoughts
were probably in the marts of trade.</p>

<p>Fred was continually going off to distant towns,
or down to the great hotels in the mountains, for
livelier diversion. His wife often insisted on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>going with him, to his evident disgust, not
because she cared to be in his company, but
because she wanted to go to the same places and
could not well go alone. Now, Fred wasn&#8217;t a
bad fellow at heart. I had known him for years,
and used to like him exceedingly. But he was
left without a father at an early age, with a considerable
fortune, and his mother was indulgent and
not overwise. He got rather fast as he grew up,
and then he contracted a thoughtless marriage
with Lizzie Carleton, a handsome and stylish young
lady, fond of dress and gay society, and without
a notion of domestic responsibility or duty.
Like most women who are not positively bad,
she had in her heart a desire to be right, but she
didn&#8217;t know how. She was all impulse, and gave
way to whims and feelings, as if helpless in any
effort to manage her own waywardness. As a
natural consequence there were constant jars
between the pair. Fred took to his clubs and
mingled with men of the race-course and the billiard
halls, and Lizzie beguiled herself as best she
could with her fashionable friends.</p>

<p>And where was Miss Van Duzen these long and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>tedious days? They were never tedious to her,
for she was always on the go. She would go off
alone on interminable strolls, and bring back loads
of flowers and strange plants, and she could tell
all about them too. Her knowledge of botany
was wonderful, and she could make very clever
sketches; she would sit by the hour on some lonely
rock, putting picturesque scenery on paper, just for
the love of it; for when the pictures were done she
would give them away or throw them away without
the least compunction. She had a fine sense
of the ludicrous and was all the time seeing funny
things, which she described in a manner quite inimitable.
She had grown up in New York, before
her father&#8217;s death, in the most select of Knickerbocker
circles, but there was not a trace of aristocracy
in her ways. She was sociable with the
ostler and the office-boy, and agreeable to the
neighboring farmers, talking with them with a
spirit that quite delighted them. And yet there
was nothing free and easy in her ways that encouraged
undue familiarity. It was merely natural
ease and good nature. She inspired respect in
everybody but my mother-in-law, who was puzzled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>with her conduct, so different from her own ideas
of propriety, and yet so free from real vulgarity.
Mrs. Pinkerton could by no means approve of her,
and yet she could accuse her of no offence which
the most rigid could seriously censure.</p>

<p>Miss Van was the life of the company when
she was about, telling of her adventures, getting
up impromptu amusements in the parlor, and
planning excursions. She was the only person
in the world, probably, who was quite familiar
with Mr. Desmond, and she would sit on his
knee, pull his whiskers, and call him an &#8220;awful
glum old fogy,&#8221; whereat he would laugh and say
she had gayety enough for them both. He admired
and loved her for the very qualities that he
lacked.</p>

<p>All this while I was trying to win the gracious
favor of my mother-in-law, but it was up-hill
work. She would answer me with severe politeness,
and volunteer an occasional remark intended
to be pleasant, but the moment I seemed to be
gaining headway, a turn at billiards with Marston,
for whom she had a great aversion, a thoughtless
expression with a flavor of profanity in it, or my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>cigars, which I now indulged in without restraint,
brought back her freezing air of disapproval.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; I yawned sometimes, &#8220;why can&#8217;t I
go ahead and enjoy myself without minding that
very respectable and severe old woman?&#8221; But I
couldn&#8217;t do it. I was always feeling the influence
of those eyes, and even of her thoughts. I
couldn&#8217;t get away from it. Sunday came, and
Mrs. Pinkerton expressed the hope that we were
to attend divine service together. I hadn&#8217;t
thought of it till that moment, and then it struck
me as a terrible bore. There was no church
within ten miles except a little white, meek edifice
in the neighboring village, occupied alternately
by Methodist and Baptist expounders of a
very Calvinistic, and, to me, a very unattractive
sort of religion. It was not altogether to my
mother-in-law&#8217;s liking, but she regarded any
church as far better than none.</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume you will go, sir,&#8221; she said, addressing
me when I made no reply to the previous hint.
She always used &#8220;sir,&#8221; with a peculiar emphasis,
when any suggestion was intended to have the
force of a command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>&#8220;Well, really, I had not thought about it,&#8221; I
said, rather vexed, as I secretly made up my mind,
reckless of my policy of conciliation, that I would
not go at any price. A tedious, droning sermon
of an hour and perhaps an hour and a half in a
country church, full of dismal doctrines,&mdash;the
sermon, not the church,&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t stand, I
thought.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pinkerton&#8217;s eyes were upon me, waiting
for a more definite answer. &#8220;I&mdash;well, no, I don&#8217;t
think I really feel like it this morning. I thought
I would read to Bessie quietly in our room, and
take a rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Bessie and I will
walk down to the village.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The deuce you will!&#8221; I thought; &#8220;walk a mile
and a half on a dusty road; to be bored!&#8221; I
knew it was useless to protest, and I was too wilful
to take back what I had said, have the team
harnessed, and go, like a good fellow, to church.
&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll be blowed if I do!&#8221; I muttered.</p>

<p>So off went the widow and her daughter without
me. Bessie tripped around to me on the piazza,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>looking like a fairy in her white dress and bit of
blue ribbon, gave me a sweet kiss, and said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
be back before dinner. Have a nice quiet time,
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; have a nice quiet time, and you gone
off with that old dragon!&#8221; It was a wicked
thought, for she was not a bit of a dragon, but
the feeling came over me that I was going to feel
miserable all the forenoon, and so I did. Miss
Van and her uncle had gone early to the neighboring
town, the largest in the county, for church and
the opportunity of observing; Fred and his wife
had gone, the night before, round to the other
side of the mountains, where there was to be a
sort of ball or hop at the leading hotel; and the
rest of the people in the house might as well have
been in the moon, for all that I cared about them.
A nice quiet time! Oh, yes; lounging about and
trying to think of something besides Mrs. Pinkerton
and my own shabby behavior. I would ten
times rather have been in the dullest country
church that ever echoed to the voice of the old
and unimproved theology of Calvin&#8217;s day. But I
was in for it, and lay in the hammock and looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>through the stables, tried to read, tried to sleep,
started on a walk and came back, and almost
cursed the quiet country Sunday, as specially calculated
to make a man of sense feel wretched.</p>

<p>At last Bessie and her mother returned, and we
had dinner. In the afternoon I was an outcast
from Mrs. Pinkerton&#8217;s favor, but I had Bessie and
read to her, and, on the whole, got through the
rest of the day comfortably.</p>

<p>The week following I began to feel that this
was getting tiresome. Under other circumstances
it might be very pleasant, but really I began to
doubt whether I was enjoying it. But I made up
my mind that during these days of leisure I
ought to be making progress in the favor of my
mother-in-law, with whom I was destined to live,
nobody could say how many years. I couldn&#8217;t
and wouldn&#8217;t make a martyr or a hypocrite of
myself. I wouldn&#8217;t conceal my actions or deny
myself freedom. So I smoked with Fred, played
billiards, rolled ten-pins with Fred&#8217;s wife and
Miss Van, and even beguiled Bessie into that vigorous
and healthful exercise, which brought a gentle
reprimand from her mother, addressed to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>but directed at me. She did not think that kind
of amusement becoming to ladies who had a
proper respect for themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, mamma, Miss Van Duzen plays, and
says she thinks it jolly fun,&#8221; said Bessie innocently.</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t alter the case in the least,&#8221; was
the rejoinder. &#8220;Miss Van Duzen can judge for
herself. I don&#8217;t think it proper. Besides, your
husband&#8217;s familiar way with those ladies&mdash;one of
whom is married and no better than she ought to
be, if appearances mean anything&mdash;does not please
me at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O mamma, how absurd! I see no harm in it
at all, and poor Lizzie, I am sure, never means
any harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, my dear, I don&#8217;t wish to say anything
about other people, and I only hope you
will never have occasion to see any harm in your
husband&#8217;s evident preference for the company of
people with loose notions about proper and becoming
behavior.&#8221;</p>

<p>On Saturday of that week a little incident
occurred that raised me perceptibly in Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>Pinkerton&#8217;s estimation. The great, lumbering
stage-coach came up just at evening, more heavily
laden than usual, and top-heavy with trunks piled
up on the roof. The driver dashed along with his
customary recklessness, the six horses breaking
into a canter as they turned to come up the rather
steep acclivity to the house. The coach was
drawn about a foot from its usual rut, one of the
wheels struck a projecting stone, and over went
the huge vehicle, passengers, trunks, and all. The
driver took a terrible leap and was stunned. The
horses stopped and looked calmly around on the
havoc. There was great consternation in and
about the house. Here my natural self-possession
came into full play. I took command of the
situation at once, directed prompt and vigorous
efforts to the extrication of the passengers, had
the injured ones taken into the house, applied
proper restoratives, and in a few minutes ascertained
that only one was seriously hurt. She was
a young girl, who had insisted on riding outside,
higher up even than the driver. She had been
thrown headlong, striking, fortunately, on the
grass, but terribly bruising one side of her face and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>dislocating her left shoulder. In a trice I had
made her as comfortable as possible; dashed down
to the village for the nearest doctor, having had
the forethought to order a team harnessed in anticipation
of such a necessity; and, having started
the doctor up in a hurry, kept on to the neighboring
county town for a surgeon who had considerable
local reputation. I had him on the ground in
a surprisingly short time, and before bedtime the
unfortunate girl was put in the way of recovery,
having received no internal injury.</p>

<p>My behavior in this affair, as I said, gave me a
lift in my mother-in-law&#8217;s estimation, and of course
filled Bessie with the most unbounded admiration,
though I had never thought of the moral effect
of my action. In the morning I determined to
follow up my advantage. It was Sunday again,
and I bespoke the team early, to go to the neighboring
town, where there was an Episcopal
church, and where, for that day, a distinguished
divine from the city, who was spending his vacation
in those parts, was to hold forth. When I
had announced my preparation for the religious
observance of the day, I actually received what was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>almost a smile of approval from my mother-in-law.
I enjoyed the ride, and was not greatly bored by the
service, for I was thinking of something else most
of the time, or amusing my mind with the native
congregation. We got back late to dinner, and
the rest had left the dining-room. The ladies
went in without removing their bonnets, and after
dinner retired to their rooms.</p>

<p>As I came out on the piazza, Fred, who was
walking about in a restless way, puffing his cigar
with a sort of ferocity, as though determined to
put it through as speedily as possible, shouted,
&#8220;Hello! Charlie, old boy, where the eternal furies
have you been? Here I have been about this
dead, sleepy, stupid place all the morning, with
nothing to do and nobody to speak to!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, where&#8217;s Mrs. M.?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lib? Oh, she&#8217;s been here, but then she was
reading a ghastly stupid novel, and wasn&#8217;t company;
and she went off to the big boarding-house
down the road half a mile, to dine with a friend.
I wouldn&#8217;t go to the blasted place, and really
think she didn&#8217;t want me to. But where in
thunder were you all the while?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>&#8220;At church, to be sure, with my wife and her
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; was the reply, peculiarly prolonged,
as if the idea never occurred to him before. &#8220;How
long since you became so pious, old man?
Didn&#8217;t suppose you knew what the inside of a
church was used for. The outside is mainly useful
to put a clock on, where it can be seen. Old
Pink,&mdash;beg pardon! Mrs. Pinkerton,&mdash;I suppose,
dragged you along by main force.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. I went of my own motion; in fact,
suggested it to the ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so! Well, I see she is bringing
you around. It is she that is destined to gain
the supremacy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw! Is my going to church such an indication
of submission? It wouldn&#8217;t do you any
harm to go to church once in a while, Fred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; he said, taking
out his cigar, and stretching his feet to the top
of the balustrade; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that. I
am afraid it might be the ruin of me. I might
become awfully pious, and then what a stick and
a moping man of rags I should become. I tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>you, Charlie, my boy, there&#8217;s many a good fellow
spoilt by too much church and Sunday school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;but you and I are beyond
danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes, but you can&#8217;t be too careful of
yourself, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answering that, and we relapsed
into commonplace, and finished our cigars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s old Dives to-day, and his charming
niece, the lively Van?&#8221; asked Fred, after an
uncommon fit of silent contemplation.</p>

<p>&#8220;They went over to some town thirty or forty
miles away, yesterday, and haven&#8217;t got back,&#8221;
I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you, that girl knows how to circumvent
these stupid Sundays, don&#8217;t she, though? And
she takes old Dives along wherever she wants to
go. I believe she would take him where the
other Dives went, if she was disposed to take a
trip there herself. But, holy Jerusalem! what
are we to do to get through the rest of the day.
No company, no billiards, no fishing. Confound
the prejudices of society. I tell you, it is just
such women as that mother-in-law of yours that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>keep society intimidated, as it were, into artificial
proprieties. Now where&#8217;s the harm of a
pleasant game on a Sunday, more than sitting
here and grumbling and cursing because there&#8217;s
nothing to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>I made no reply, and Fred lighted another cigar.
He was evidently thinking of something. &#8220;Look
here, old fellow,&#8221; he said at length in an undertone,
something very unusual with him, &#8220;come up to
my room. You haven&#8217;t seen it. Lib won&#8217;t be back
till teatime, and perhaps we can find something to
amuse ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led the way and I followed, thinking no
harm. His room was up stairs and on the back
of the house, looking up the great hill that stretched
back to the clouds. As we entered, I found he
had brought a good many things with him, and
given the room much the air of the quarters of a
bachelor in the city. His sleeping-room was separate
from that, and formed a sort of boudoir for his
wife. He motioned me to an easy-chair, set a box
of fine cigars on the table, and going to the closet
brought out a decanter of sherry and some glasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;In these cursed places, you can get nothing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>drink,&#8221; he said, &#8220;unless on the sly, and I hate that;
so I bring along my own beverages, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw and tasted, and found it very good. He
was still fumbling about the closet, with profane
ejaculations, and finally emerged with something in
his hand that I at first took for a small book.
But he unblushingly put on the table that pasteboard
volume sometimes called the Devil&#8217;s Bible.
&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, &#8220;where&#8217;s the harm? Let us
have a quiet game of Casino or California Jack,
or something else. It is better than perishing of
stupidity.&#8221;</p>

<p>I demurred. I was not over-scrupulous, but I
had sufficient of my early breeding left to have a
qualm of conscience at the thought of playing
cards on Sunday.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nonsense!&#8221; said Fred, carelessly, as he
proceeded to deal the cards for Casino. &#8220;There,
you have an ace and little Casino right before you.
Go ahead, old man!&#8221;</p>

<p>I made a feeble show of protesting, but took
up my cards, and, finding that I could capture the
ace and little Casino, took them. From that the
play went on; I became quite absorbed, and dismissed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>my scruples, when, as the sun was getting
low, a shadow passed the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Jupiter!&#8221; I exclaimed, looking up.
&#8220;Does that second-story piazza go all the way
round here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure,&#8221; answered Fred, whose back was
to the window. &#8220;Why not? What did you
see,&mdash;a spook?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother-in-law!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mrs. Pinkerton!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you care? You are your own
boss, I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course; but she will be terribly
offended, and I think it would be pleasanter for
all concerned to keep in her good graces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gammon! Assert your rights, be master of
yourself, and teach the old woman her place.
D&mdash;&mdash; me, if I would have a mother-in-law riding
over me, or prying around to see what I was about!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am sure she passed the window by accident.
She would never pry around; it isn&#8217;t her
style; she has a fine sense of propriety, has my
mother-in-law!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, yes, old Pink is the pink of propriety, no
doubt about that!&#8221; said the rascal, laughing heartily
at his heartless pun.</p>

<p>But I couldn&#8217;t laugh. I saw plainly enough
that I had lost more than all the ground that I had
gained in my mother-in-law&#8217;s favor, and my task
would be harder than ever. I had no more desire
to play cards, and sauntered down stairs and out
of doors as if nothing had happened. At the tea-table
Mrs. Pinkerton was very impressive in her
manner, but showed no direct consciousness of anything
new. On the piazza, after tea, she was uncommonly
affable to her daughter, and, I thought,
a little disposed to keep Bessie from talking to
me. The latter appeared troubled somewhat, and
looked at me in an anxious way, as if longing to
rush into my arms and ask me all about it and say
how willingly she forgave me; but her mother
kept her within the circle of her influence, and I
sat apart, harboring unutterable thoughts and saying
nothing. At last Mrs. Pinkerton arose, and
said sweetly, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t stay out any later, dear,
it is rather damp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay with me, Bessie,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I want to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>speak to you. Your mother is at liberty to go in
whenever she pleases.&#8221; It was then she gave me
a disdainful look and swept in, and I muttered
the wish regarding her transportation to a distant
clime, which brought out the gentle rebuke with
which this story opens.</p>

<p>I saw no prospect of enjoying a longer stay at
the Fairview, unless some burglary or terrible
accident should occur to give me chance for a new
display of my heroic qualities, and even then, I
thought, it would be of no use, for I should spoil
it all next day. So we determined to go home
a week earlier than we had intended. The Marstons
were going to Canada and Lake George, and
wouldn&#8217;t reach home till October. Mr. Desmond
and his niece stayed a month longer where they
were, and that would bring them home about the
same time. Bessie and I went home with a lack
of that buoyant bliss with which we had travelled
to the mountains and spent those first two weeks.
There was no change in us, but it was all due to
my mother-in-law.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="caption">WHAT IS HOME WITHOUT A MOTHER-IN-LAW?</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ome!</span> We were back from the mountains,
and our brief wedding-journey had become
a thing of the past. Mrs. Pinkerton&#8217;s iron-bound
trunk had been reluctantly deposited in her bed-chamber
by a puffing and surly hack-driver; and
here was I, installed in the little cottage as head
of the household, for weal or for woe. It was
Mrs. Pinkerton&#8217;s cottage, to be sure, but I entered
it with the determination not to live there as a
boarder or as a guest subject to the proprietor&#8217;s
condescending hospitality. I was able and not unwilling
to establish a home of my own, and inasmuch
as I refrained from doing so because of Mrs.
Pinkerton&#8217;s desire to keep her daughter with her,
I had the right to consider myself under no obligation
to my mother-in-law.</p>

<p>The cottage was far from being a disagreeable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>place in itself. It was small, but extremely neat
and pleasant. The rooms were furnished with a
degree of quiet taste that defied criticism. The
hand of an accomplished housekeeper was everywhere
made manifest, and everything had an air
of refinement and comfort. There was no ostentatious
furniture; the chairs were made to sit in,
but not to put one&#8217;s boots on. The cleanliness of
the house was terrible. One could see that no
man had lived there since the death of the late
Pinkerton.</p>

<p>Our room was the same that had been occupied
by Bessie since she was a school-girl in short
frocks. It was full of Bessie&#8217;s &#8220;things,&#8221; and it
was lucky that my effects occupied but very little
space.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is jolly,&#8221; I said, as I sat down on the
edge of the bed and pulled a cigar from my
pocket. &#8220;How soon will supper be ready, I wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no response. Bessie was unpacking,&mdash;and
such an unpacking!</p>

<p>I lighted my cigar and threw myself back on
the bed, wondering how they had got on without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>me at the bank. Presently in came mother-in-law
to lend a hand at the unpacking. She did not see
me at first, but the fragrance of my Manila soon
reached her nostrils, and she turned.</p>

<p>Such a look as she cast upon me! It almost
took my breath away. But she did not say a word.
&#8220;The subject is beyond her powers of speech,&#8221; I
said to myself. &#8220;Let us hope it will be so as a
general thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, it made me feel uncomfortable, so by
and by I got off the bed and went down stairs.</p>

<p>At the supper-table I tried to make myself as
agreeable as possible. I talked over the trip, and
spoke of the people we had met at the mountains;
but I had most of the conversation to myself.
Bessie did not seem to be in a mood to chat; Mrs.
Pinkerton devoted herself to impaling me with
her eyes once in a while; in a word, the mental
atmosphere was muggy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Desmond has travelled a great deal,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;I was speaking of French politics the other day,
and he gave me a long harangue on the situation.
He was in Paris several years, when he was a
good deal younger than he is now.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>&#8220;Mr. Desmond is not a very old man,&#8221; said
Mrs. Pinkerton, &#8220;but he has passed that age
when men think they know all there is to be
known.&#8221;</p>

<p>I accepted this shot good-naturedly, and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;His niece is a remarkably bright girl,&#8221; I continued.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot say I think it either bright or proper
for a young lady to go off alone on mountain
excursions for half a day, and return with her
dress torn and her hands all scratched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it was rather imprudent, but you know
she said she had no intention of going so far when
she started, and she missed her way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not hear her excuses. She appeared to
be a spoiled child, and her manners were insufferably
offensive. I should have known she came
from New York, even if I had not been told.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think all New-Yorkers are loud?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said no such thing. There is a class of New
York young people who are so &#8216;loud&#8217; that respectable
people cannot have anything to do with
them without lowering themselves. Miss Van
Duzen belongs to that class.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&#8220;You are rough on her, upon my word. I
don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s half so bad, do you, Bessie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I liked her very much,&#8221; said Bessie. &#8220;She
may not be our style exactly, but I think at heart
she is a good, true girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if she will call,&#8221; I said. &#8220;By the
way, Fred Marston is coming out to see us as
soon as he gets back to the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As to that young man,&#8221; Mrs. Pinkerton
remarked, with some show of vivacity, &#8220;he
impressed me as being little less than disreputable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Disreputable! I would have you understand
that Fred Marston is one of my friends,&#8221; I exclaimed,
growing angry, &#8220;and he is as respectable
as the rector of St. Thomas&#8217;s Church!&#8221;</p>

<p>Phew! Now I had done it. Mrs. Pinkerton
was thoroughly scandalized and offended. She
got up, and we left the table, Bessie looking troubled.
I went into the library, and after lighting
a cigar, sat down to read the papers. Bessie, who
had followed me, brushed the journal out of my
hand and seated herself on my knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charlie,&#8221; she said, kissing me, and smoothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>the hair away from my brow, &#8220;can&#8217;t you and
mamma ever get along any better than this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A conundrum! I never guessed one, so I
shall have to give this up. But don&#8217;t you see how
it is, dearest? I try to be good to her, and she
won&#8217;t meet me half-way. On the contrary, she
tries to nag me, I think. It wasn&#8217;t my fault to-night.
What right has she to run down my
friends? If she don&#8217;t like them, she might leave
them alone, and be precious sure they&#8217;d leave her
alone. She don&#8217;t like smoking; I tried to swear
off, tried mighty hard, but it was no use. You
see&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t quite necessary for you to make that
remark about the Rev. Dr. McCanon, was it,
Charlie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no; I&#8217;m sorry, but she provoked me to
it. I&#8217;ll apologize.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then, Charlie, you will try to be a little
more patient with mamma, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do try, but the trouble is that she don&#8217;t
like me. Must I keep my mouth shut, throw
away my cigars, bounce all my friends, and sit up
with my arms folded?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, no, dear. Be good to her, and be patient;
it will all come around right in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was Bessie&#8217;s way of lightening present
troubles,&mdash;&#8220;It will all come around right in
time.&#8221; Blessed hope! &#8220;Man never is, but
always to be blest.&#8221;</p>

<p>My duties now kept me at the bank nearly all
day, and for a few weeks affairs went on at home
very smoothly. At table Mrs. Pinkerton maintained
a sphinx-like silence, and I directed my
conversation to Bessie. When the old lady
opened her mouth, it was to snub me. The snub
direct, the snub indirect, the snub implied, and
the snub far-fetched,&mdash;I submitted to all with a
cheerful spirit, and not a hasty retort escaped me.</p>

<p>At Bessie&#8217;s request, I now smoked only in the
library, or in our own room. I bought a highly
ornamental Japanese affair, of curious workmanship,
as a receptacle for cigar-ashes. Altogether,
I behaved like a good boy.</p>

<p>One evening Marston dropped in. When his
card was brought up stairs, I handed it over to
Bessie, and hurried to the library.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you, old man?&#8221; he said, or, rather,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>shouted. &#8220;How do you like it, as far as you&#8217;ve
got?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tip-top. I&#8217;m glad to see you. When did
you get back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last Saturday, and mighty glad to get back
to a live place, too. Smoke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. Bessie will be down in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s old Pink?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;S-s-h! She&#8217;s all right. Don&#8217;t speak so confoundedly
loud.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha! I see how it is. By and by you
won&#8217;t dare say your soul&#8217;s your own. I pity you,
Charlie, upon my word I do. Ned Tupney was
married a few days ago, did you know it? and
he&#8217;s got a devil of a mother-in-law on his hands,
a regular roarer&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here comes my wife,&#8221; I broke in. &#8220;For
Heaven&#8217;s sake, change the subject. Talk about
roses!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie entered and exchanged a friendly greeting
with Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was telling Charlie about some wonderful
roses I saw at Primton&#8217;s green-house,&#8221; said the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>unabashed visitor, and he forthwith laid aside his
cigar&mdash;on the tablecloth!&mdash;and launched into a
glowing description of the imaginary flowers.</p>

<p>Before he had finished, Mrs. Pinkerton entered
much to my surprise. She bowed in a stately
manner, inquired formally as to the state of
Fred&#8217;s health, and as she took a seat I saw her
glance take in that cigar.</p>

<p>Fred could talk exceedingly well when he was
so disposed, and he entertained us excellently, I
thought. He had seen a good deal of the world,
was a close observer, and had the faculty of chatting
in a fascinating way about subjects that would
usually be called commonplace. He was pleased
with the aspect of the cottage, and complimented
it gracefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Love in a cottage,&#8221; he sighed, casting a quick
glance around the room,&mdash;&#8220;well, it isn&#8217;t so bad
after all, with plenty of books, a pleasant garden,
sunny rooms, a pretty view, and a mother-in-law
to look after a fellow and keep him straight.&#8221; And
the wretch looked at Mrs. Pinkerton, and laughed
in a sociable way.</p>

<p>I promptly called his attention to a beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>edition of Thackeray&#8217;s works in the bookcase, a
recent purchase.</p>

<p>In the course of a half-hour&#8217;s call, Fred managed
to introduce the dangerous topic at least a
half-dozen times, and each time I was compelled
to choke him off by ramming some other subject
down his throat willy-nilly.</p>

<p>Finally he rose to go. I accompanied him to
the front door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sociable creature, old Pink, eh?&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t love me too well. Is she always as festive
and amusing as to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on a minute,&#8221; was my reply. I ran back
and got my hat and cane, and accompanied him
toward the railroad station.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Fred,&#8221; I said, &#8220;your intentions are
good, but I wish you would quit talking about
Mrs. Pinkerton. I am doing my best to live
peaceably and comfortably in the same house with
her, and you don&#8217;t help me a bit with your gabble.
She is a very worthy woman, and not half
so stupid as you imagine. I admit that we don&#8217;t
get along together quite as I could wish, but I&#8217;m
trying to please my wife by being as good a son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>as I can be to her mother. What&#8217;s the use of
trying to rile up our little puddle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, all right!&#8221; he rejoined. &#8220;If you prefer
your puddle should be stagnant&mdash;admirable
metaphor, by the way&mdash;it shall be as you wish.
Only I hate to see the way things are going with
you, and I&#8217;m bound to tell you so. You are
losing your spirit, tying your hands, and throwing
all your manly independence to the winds.
If you live two years with that irreproachable
mummy, you won&#8217;t be worth knowing. Do you
dare go into town with me and have a game of
billiards?&#8221;</p>

<p>I went. We had several games. I got home
about midnight. The next morning, at the breakfast-table,
Mrs. Pinkerton said dryly,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your friend Marston pities you, doesn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; if he does, he wastes his emotions,&#8221;
I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you think so. He takes a good
deal of interest in your welfare, and I suppose he
could be prevailed upon to give you wise advice
in case of need.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>&#8220;I dare say. Fred is a good fellow, and advice
is as cheap as dirt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And pity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pity! Why do you think Fred pities me?
Why should he pity me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your question is hypocritical, because you
know very well that he thinks you are a victim,&mdash;a
victim of a terrible mother-in-law.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the first time she had ever spoken out so
openly. I said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will leave it to Bessie. Bessie, do I look
like a victim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Bessie, &#8220;but you are both the queerest
puzzles! Mamma is always her dearest self when
you are away, Charlie. You don&#8217;t know each other
at all yet. When you are together you are both
horrid, and when you are apart you are both lovely.
And yet I don&#8217;t know why it should be so; there
is no quarrel between you&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And Bessie began to cry. I got up.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, there&#8217;s no quarrel between us,&#8221; I said;
&#8220;but perhaps a straight-out row would be better
than forever to be eating our own vitals with suppressed
rancor.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>Mrs. Pinkerton made as if she would go around
to where Bessie sat, to condole with her, without
noticing my remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t trouble yourself,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;It&#8217;s my
place to comfort my wife.&#8221; And I took Bessie in
my arms tenderly, and kissed her tear-stained
cheek almost fiercely.</p>

<p>This theatrical demonstration caused my mother-in-law
to sweep out of the room promptly, with
her temper as nearly ruffled as I had ever seen it.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Charlie!&#8221; whimpered my poor little wife
despairingly, &#8220;what shall I do? It&#8217;s awful to
have you and mamma this way!&#8221;</p>

<p>And now it was my turn to say, &#8220;Cheer up, my
love! It will all come around right in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>But my <i>arri&egrave;re pens&eacute;e</i> was, &#8220;Would that that
burglar had bagged the old iceberg, and carried
her off to her native Nova Zembla!&#8221;</p>

<span class="caption">MISS VAN&#8217;S PARTY AND ANOTHER UNPLEASANTNESS.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne</span> day in the early fall, Mrs. Pinkerton
received a letter postmarked at Paris, which
seemed to throw her into a state of extraordinary
excitement. I knew her well enough to be certain
that she would not tell me the news, but that
I should hear it later through Bessie. Such was
the case. When I came home towards evening
and went up stairs to prepare for supper, Bessie,
who was seated in our room, said in a joyful
tone,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;George is coming home next month!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; I said; and the more I thought
of it the better it seemed. A new element would
be infused into our home life with his advent,
and I confidently believed that the widow&#8217;s society
would be vastly more tolerable when he was
among us. George had been so long in Paris that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>he had become a veritable Parisian. That he
would bring along with him a large amount of Paris
sunshine and vivacity to enliven the atmosphere of
our little circle, I felt certain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he coming to stay?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t know. He says he never makes any
plans for six months ahead. It will depend upon
circumstances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s Parisian. I&#8217;m very glad he&#8217;s
coming, and I hope circumstances will keep him
here. Isn&#8217;t old Dr. Jones pretty nearly dead?
Seems to me George could take his practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Charlie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, puss; doctors must die as well
as their patients.&#8221;</p>

<p>I broached the subject to mother-in-law at the
supper-table, and&mdash;<i>mirabile dictu!</i>&mdash;she agreed
with me that we must keep George with us when
we got him.</p>

<p>In November George arrived. He didn&#8217;t telegraph
from New York, but came right on by a
night train, and, walking into the house while we
were at breakfast, took us by surprise.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pinkerton taken by surprise was a funny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>phenomenon, and I&#8217;m afraid propriety received a
pretty smart blow when she threw her napkin into
a plate of buckwheat cakes, dropped her eye-glasses,
and rushed to meet the long-lost prodigal.</p>

<p>As for George, he brought such a gale into the
house with him&mdash;there are plenty of them on the
Atlantic in November&mdash;that everything seemed
metamorphosed. He laughed and shouted, and
hugged first one of us and then another, and
finally sat down and ate breakfast enough for six
Frenchmen, every minute ripping out some wicked
little French oath and winking at his mother with
the utmost complacency. Never since I had
become an inmate of the cottage had we enjoyed
a meal so much as that one. There was an
<i>abandon</i>, an <i>insouciance</i>, an <i>esprit</i>, a <i>je-ne-sais-quoi</i>
about this young frog-eater that thoroughly
carried away the whole party, including even Mrs.
Pinkerton.</p>

<p>When George had eaten everything he could
find on the table, he lighted a cigarette,&mdash;right
there in the dining-room, too, and under his
mother&#8217;s eyes,&mdash;and we had a good, long, jolly
talk together, Bessie sitting between us and feasting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>her eyes on her brother&#8217;s comeliness. He
certainly was handsome.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no plans,&#8221; he said, &#8220;except to loaf here
awhile and wait for an opening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A French Micawber,&#8221; said I. &#8220;And I suppose
you know all about medicine and surgery?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have learned when not to give medicine, I
believe, and so, I think, I can save lots of lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few days after George&#8217;s arrival we received
a call from the Watsons. I had never had the
pleasure of meeting the Watsons, but I had had
the Watsons held up before me as examples of the
right sort of style so many times, that I felt already
well acquainted with them.</p>

<p>Mr. Watson was a very retiring, quiet little
man, awed into obscurity by his wife. After a
long and persistent effort to interest him in conversation,
I was compelled to give it up, and to
leave him smiling blankly, with his gaze directed
toward the Argand burner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Watson was immense in every sense of
the word. Her moral and mental dimensions
were awe-inspiring; and she delivered what I afterwards
found, on reflection, to be very commonplace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>utterances in a style in which unction,
dogmatism, self-satisfaction, and finality were predominant.
Once, when she had brought forth an
unusually imposing sentence, her husband fairly
smacked his lips.</p>

<p>The Watsons had no children. They were
among the most prominent attendants of St.
Thomas&#8217;s, and the old gentleman was reputed to
be worth about a million.</p>

<p>George came in while the call was in progress,
and after greeting the Watsons, he turned to Mrs.
W., and uttered one of the most polished, delicate,
pleasing little compliments it has ever been
my fortune to hear uttered. Then he quietly withdrew
into the background.</p>

<p>Just then some more callers were announced,
and what was my surprise to see Mr. Desmond
and Miss Van Duzen enter. The former was as
resplendent as to his watch-chain as ever, and his
niece looked charming. Introductions all round
followed, and the company broke up into groups.</p>

<p>George took a seat near Miss Van, and a brisk fire
of conversation was soon under way between them,
varied by frequent bursts of friendly laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>Mr. Desmond soon drew out Mr. Watson, and
their talk was on stocks, bonds, and the like.</p>

<p>After Mrs. Watson had proved her theory of
the laws of the universe, and had almost intoxicated
my worthy mother-in-law with her glittering
rhetoric, the Watsons took their departure. Before
the others followed their example, Miss Van
extended an informal invitation to us to attend a
&#8220;social gathering&#8221; at her uncle&#8217;s residence the
following Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>We went, of course, Mrs. Pinkerton, George,
Bessie, and I. It was a pleasant party, and it
could not have been otherwise with Miss Van as
the hostess. There was a little dancing,&mdash;not
enough to entitle it to be called a dancing-party;
a little card-playing,&mdash;not enough to make it a
card-party; and there was a vast amount of bright
and pleasant conversation, but still one could not
name it a <i>converzatione</i>. The company was remarkably
good, and Miss Van&#8217;s management,
although imperceptible, was so skilful that her
guests found themselves at their ease, and enjoying
themselves, without knowing that their pleasure
was more than half due to her <i>finesse</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>George was quite a lion, and I envied his easy
tact, his unconscious grace of manner, and his
faculty of saying bright things without effort. He
and Miss Van got on famously together, and she
found him an efficient and trustworthy aid in her
capacity as hostess.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pinkerton made a lovely wall-flower, and
I could not refrain from a wicked chuckle when I
saw her sitting on a sofa, exchanging commonplaces
with a puffing dowager. Presently, however,
I noticed that she had gone, and I found
that Mr. Desmond had been kind enough to
relieve me from the onerous duty of taking her
down to supper.</p>

<p>I wish I had a printed bill of fare of that supper,
for even George, fresh from V&eacute;four&#8217;s and the
Trois Fr&egrave;res Proven&ccedil;aux, acknowledged that it
was sublime, magnificent, perfect. We men folks,
in fact, talked so much about it afterwards, that
Bessie rebuked us by remarking that &#8220;men didn&#8217;t
care about anything so much as eating.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Fred Marston remarked to me, while helping
himself a third time to the salad, &#8220;It&#8217;s a stunning
old lay-out, isn&#8217;t it!&#8221; His wife was there,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>dressed &#8220;to kill,&#8221; as he himself said, and dancing
with every gentleman she could decoy into asking
her.</p>

<p>After we had come up from the supper-room,
Fred Marston pulled me into a corner, and inflicted
on me a volley of stinging observations
about the people in the room. George, Bessie,
Mrs. Pinkerton, and Miss Van were, I supposed,
in one of the other rooms; I had lost sight of
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Jenks lost a cool hundred thousand fighting
the tiger at Saratoga, this last summer,&#8221; said
Fred. &#8220;I had it from a man who backed him.
Do you know that young widow talking with him
near the end of the piano? No? Why, that&#8217;s
Mrs. Delascelles, and a devil of a little piece she
is,&mdash;twice divorced and once widowed, and she
isn&#8217;t a day over twenty-five. You ought to know
her. By the way, that brother of yours is a
whole team, with a bull-pup under the wagon.
Does he let old Pink boss him around as she does
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fine night,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Delightful! I say, Charlie, it must be a terrible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>bore to lug the old woman around to all these
shindigs with you, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think about the State election?&#8221;
I demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Republicans have got a dead sure thing,
I&#8217;ll lay you a V. She has bulldozed you till you
don&#8217;t dare open your head, my boy. Yours is
one of the saddest and most malignant cases of
mother-in-law I ever struck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fred,&#8221; I said, in hopes of bringing his tirade
to an end, &#8220;your friendship is slightly oppressive.
Confine your attentions to your own grievances.
I will take care of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! at last you acknowledge that you have
one. Confess, now, that old Pink is a confounded
nuisance!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, yes, she is! Does that satisfy
you, scandal-monger? Now, for Heaven&#8217;s sake,
shut up!&#8221;</p>

<p>I heard a brisk rustling of silk just at my left
and a little back of where I sat, and some one
passed toward the front parlor.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; ejaculated Fred, looking intently.
&#8220;It&#8217;s old Pink herself, and I hope she got the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>benefit of what we said about her. I had no
idea she was sitting near us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>we</i> said about her!&#8221; I repeated. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t say anything about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you did. Ha, ha! You said she was a
confounded nuisance!&#8221;</p>

<p>I shuddered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, brace up! Perhaps she didn&#8217;t hear
that impious remark,&#8221; said Fred, chuckling maliciously.
&#8220;Or if she did, perhaps she&#8217;ll let you
off easy: only a few hours in the dark closet,
or bread and water for a day or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound your mischief-making tongue!&#8221; I
growled. &#8220;Here comes Miss Van Duzen to bid
you quit spreading scandal about her guests.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Van Duzen, on the contrary, only wished
Mr. Marston to secure a partner for the Lanciers,
which he promptly did.</p>

<p>I sat brooding while the dancing went on, and
was somewhat astonished, when it was over, to
see George making for my corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s this?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you go home
with them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With them? What! You don&#8217;t mean to say&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>&#8220;But I do, though! Bessie and mother made
their adieux half an hour ago, and I thought of
course you had gone home with them, as nothing
was said to me. This is a pretty go! Bessie
must have been ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;I should have
known if that was the case. Where&#8217;s Miss Van?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw her. She thought it was odd, but supposed
you had gone with them. What could have
started them off in that fashion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, don&#8217;t let&#8217;s stand here talking.
Come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>We did not stop for ceremony. Rushing up
stairs, we donned our hats and coats, and made
our way out to the sidewalk without losing any
time. I hailed a carriage, and we drove rapidly
out of town. It was about half past one o&#8217;clock
when we arrived home. There were lights in our
room and in Mrs. Pinkerton&#8217;s chamber. George
followed me up stairs, and I tapped at the door of
our room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it you, Charlie?&#8221; said Bessie&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&mdash;and George.&#8221;</p>

<p>She opened the door. It was evidently not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>long since their arrival home, for she had not
begun to undress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Explain, for our benefit, the new method of
leaving a party,&#8221; said George, &#8220;and why it was
deemed necessary to give us a scare in inaugurating
the same.&#8221; He threw himself into an easy-chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps Mr. Travers is better able to tell you
why mother should have left in the way she did,&#8221;
said Bessie, trying to make her speech sound sarcastic
and cutting, but finding it a difficult job,
with her breath coming and going so quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The deuce he is!&#8221; roared George. &#8220;Come,
Charlie, what have you been up to? I must get it
out of some of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am utterly unable to tell you why your
mother should have left in the way she did,&#8221; was
all I could find to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sapristi! This is getting mysterious and
blood-curdling. The latest <i>feuilleton</i> is nothing to
it. Must I go to bed without knowing the cause
of this escapade? Well, so be it. But let me
tell you, young woman, that it wasn&#8217;t the thing
to do. If you find your husband flirting with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>some siren, you must lead him off by the ear next
time, but don&#8217;t sulk. Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>George walked out and shut the door after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Bessie,&#8221; I said kindly, &#8220;don&#8217;t cry,
because I want to talk sensibly with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was sobbing now in good earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to tell me what your mother said
to you about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She couldn&#8217;t talk just then, poor little woman!
But when she had had her cry partly out, she
told me.</p>

<p>Her mother had not told her a word of what
had passed between Fred Marston and me! The
outraged dignity of the widow would not admit of
an explicit account of the unspeakable insult she
had received. She had simply given Bessie to
understand that I had uttered some unpardonable,
infamous slander, and had hustled the poor girl
breathlessly into a cab and away, before she fairly
realized what had happened.</p>

<p>I then told Bessie what our conversation had
been, and left her to judge for herself. I had not
the heart to scold her for her part in the French
leave-taking, though it made me feel miserable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>think how few episodes of such a sort might bring
about endless misunderstandings and heart-aches.</p>

<p>Of course more or less talk was caused by the
mysterious manner of our several departures from
Miss Van&#8217;s party; and, thanks to Fred Marston
and his wife and similar rattle-pates, it became
generally known that there was a skeleton in the
Pinkerton closet.</p>

<p>Miss Van soon heard how it came about, and
nothing could have afforded a more complete
proof of her refinement of character than the delicacy
and tact with which she ignored the whole
affair.</p>

<span class="caption">ANOTHER CHARLIE IN THE FIELD.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> winter, with its petty trials and contentions,
had gone by; spring, with its bloom and
fragrance, was far advanced; and already another
summer, with its possible pleasures and recreations,
was close upon us. Before it had fairly set
in, however, an event of extraordinary importance
was to occur in our little household. There had
been premonitions of it for some time, which had
a tendency to soften and soothe all asperities,
and cause a rather sober and subdued air to pervade
the little cottage, and now there were active
preparations going on. Of course, the widow was
gradually assuming the management of the whole
affair, and it was a matter in which I could hardly
venture to dispute her right. Her experience and
knowledge were certainly superior to mine, and it
was an affair in which these qualities were very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>important. In fact, I seemed to be counted out
altogether in the preparations, as if it was something
in the nature of a surprise party in my
honor. Mrs. Pinkerton had an air of mysterious
and exclusive knowledge concerning the grand
event. Miss Van, who had come to have confidential
relations with Bessie, of the most intimate
kind, notwithstanding the mother&#8217;s objections,
knew all about it, but had a queer way of appearing
unconscious of anything unusual. There
seemed to be a general consent to a shallow pretence
that I was in utter and hopeless ignorance.
It annoyed me a little, as I flattered myself that I
knew quite as much about what was coming as any
of them, and I thought it silly to make believe I
didn&#8217;t, and to ignore my interest in the affair.
Bessie had no secrets from me, of course, and our
understanding was complete, but one might have
thought from appearances that we had less concern
in the matter than anybody else.</p>

<p>As the auspicious time drew near, the goings-on
increased in mystery and the widow&#8217;s control
grew more and more complete. Bessie showed
me one day a wardrobe that amused me immensely.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>It was quite astonishing in its extent
and variety, but so liliputian in the dimensions of
the separate garments as to seem ridiculous to
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t they cunning?&#8221; said the dear girl, holding
up one after another of the various articles of
raiment. Then she showed me a basket, marvellously
constructed, with a mere skeleton of wicker-work
and coverings of pink silk and fine lace, and
furnished with toilet appliances that seemed to
belong to a fairy; and finally, removing a big quilt
that had excited my curiosity, she showed me the
most startling object of all,&mdash;a cradle! I had seen
such things before and felt no particular thrill, but
this had a strange effect upon me. I didn&#8217;t stop
to inquire how these things had all been smuggled
into the house without my knowledge or consent,
but kissed my little wife fondly, and went down
stairs in a musing and pensive mood.</p>

<p>The next day a decree of virtual exile was pronounced
upon me. My mother-in-law thought
perhaps it would be better if I would occupy
another room in the house for a time, and let her
share Bessie&#8217;s chamber. The poor, dear girl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>might need her care at any time, and the widow
looked at me as much as to say, &#8220;You cannot be
expected to know anything about these matters,
and have nothing to do but obey my directions.&#8221;
I consented without a murmur or the least show
of resistance, for I admitted everything that could
possibly be said, and lost all my spirit of independence
in view of the impressive event that was
coming. So I meekly took to the attic, and put
up with the most forlorn and desolate quarters.
One or two mornings after, I was aroused at an
inhuman hour, and ordered in the most imperative
tones to call in Dr. Lyman as quickly as possible,
and haste after Mrs. Sweet. I hurried into my
clothes in the utmost agitation, raced down the
street in a manner that led a watchful policeman
to stop me and inquire my business, rung up the
doctor with the most unbecoming violence, and
delivered my errand up a speaking-tube, in answer
to his muffled, &#8220;What&#8217;s wanted?&#8221; Then I
rushed to the neighboring stable, and got up the
sleepy hostler with as much vehemence in my
manner as if he were in danger of being burned
to death, and induced him to harness a team,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>in what I considered about twice the necessary
length of time; drove three miles in the morning
twilight for Mrs. Sweet, a motherly old maid in
the nursing business, who had officiated at Bessie&#8217;s
own <i>d&eacute;but</i> upon the stage of life. When I
had got back and returned the team to the stable,
and was walking about the lower rooms in a restless
manner, feeling as if I had suddenly become
a hopeless outcast, the doctor came down stairs,
and said, with amazing calmness, as though it
was the most commonplace thing in the world,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting on nicely. Fine boy, sir! Mrs. Travers
is quite comfortable. Will look in again in
the course of the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I was left alone again, an outcast and a
wanderer in my own home. All the life was up
stairs, including the wee bit of new life that had
come to venture upon the perils and vicissitudes
of the great world. It was two hours, but it
seemed a month, before any one relieved my solitude,
and then it was at Bessie&#8217;s interposition&mdash;in
fact, a command that she had to insist upon until
her mother was afraid of her getting excited&mdash;that
I was admitted to behold the mysteries above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>Well, it is nobody&#8217;s business about the particulars
of that chamber. It was too sacred for
description; but there was the tiny, quivering,
red new-comer, already dressed in some of the
dainty liliputian garments, and very much astonished
and not altogether pleased at the effect.
Bessie was proud and happy, the nurse, moving
about silently, knew just what to do and how to do
it, and the mother-in-law held supreme command.
She was grand and severe, and evidently her wishes
had been disregarded in respect to the sex of
her grandchild. She feared the consequences of
another Charlie launched into a world already too
degenerate, and she had hoped for an addition to
the superior sex. But Bessie and I were mightily
pleased that it was a boy.</p>

<p>There was little to be said then, but in a few
days the restraint began to be relaxed, and discussions
arose about what had become the most important
member of the household. Even the
widow must be content with the second place
now, but I began to have misgivings lest my
position had been permanently fixed as the third.
In my secret mind, however, I determined to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>assert my rights as soon as Bessie was strong
again, and reduce my mother-in-law to the position
in which she belonged. I had put off doing it too
long, and advantage might be taken of the present
juncture of affairs to strengthen her claim to
supremacy, and it really wouldn&#8217;t do to delay
much longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he looks just like Charlie,&#8221; said Bessie
to Miss Van, the first time the latter called after
the great event.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;It
seems to me he has his papa&#8217;s dark eyes, but I
can&#8217;t see any other resemblance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I do!&#8221; Bessie replied with spirit. &#8220;Why,
it is just his forehead and mouth, and his hair will
be just the same beautiful brown when he grows
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady was looking on reproachfully, and
finally said, &#8220;Bessie, my dear, that child looks
precisely like your own family. George at his
age was just such an infant; you couldn&#8217;t tell
them apart.&#8221;</p>

<p>George entered the room at that moment, and
with his boisterous laugh said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>to say that I was ever such a little, soft, ridiculous
lump of humanity as that, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As like as two peas,&#8221; was the reply of his
mother.</p>

<p>For my part I kept out of the discussion, for I
must confess I could see no resemblance between
the precious baby and any other mortal creature,
except another baby of the same age. I thought
they looked pretty much all alike, and was not
prepared to deny that it was the exact counterpart
of anybody at that particular stage of development.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what, Bess,&#8221; said George, after the
debate had fully subsided, &#8220;you must name that
little chap for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; replied the proud mother, &#8220;that is
all settled; his name is Charlie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing had been said on the subject before,
and I was a little startled at Bessie&#8217;s positive manner,
for I thought even this matter would not be
free from her mother&#8217;s dictation. The old lady
seemed surprised and vexed. &#8220;George is a much
better name, I think,&#8221; she said very quietly, keeping
down her vexation, &#8220;but I thought perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>you might remember your dear father in this
matter. His name, you know, was Benjamin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; said Bessie, very firmly, &#8220;but I
think there is one with a still higher claim, and
the child&#8217;s name is Charles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for you, little girl!&#8221; I thought, but I
said nothing. Within me I felt a gleeful satisfaction
at Bessie&#8217;s spirit, which showed that if it ever
came to a sharp contest with her mother, nothing
could keep her from holding her own place by
her husband&#8217;s side. All my misgivings about
her possible estrangement by her mother&#8217;s influence
vanished, and I saw that the new tie
between us would be stronger than any earthly
power.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said George abruptly, after a pause, &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t be so disobliging about a little thing like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! you wait until you can afford the opportunity
of furnishing names, and see what you will
do,&#8221; I said jokingly. My joke was not generally
appreciated. The widow gave me a look a little
short of savage. Bessie suppressed a smile, in
order to give me a reproof with her eyes, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>Miss Van just then thought of something wholly
irrelevant to say, as if she had not noticed my
remark at all. On the whole, I was made to feel
that it was a disgraceful failure.</p>

<span class="caption">THE SHADOW ON OUR LIFE.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">A</span>nother</span> summer with all its glory was upon
us. It was nearly a year since we were married,
and I was beginning to feel the dignity of
a family man. As Bessie regained her strength
and bloom, she seemed to have a matronly grace
and self-command quite new to her. As I looked
back over our married life I saw no dark shadows,
no coldness between us two, no misunderstandings
that need occasion regret, but somehow
it seemed as though that year had not been so
bright and happy as it ought to have been. We
had lived under an irksome restraint that was
depressing. I had felt it more than Bessie, for
she had been accustomed to submit to her mother,
and did not chafe, but she plainly saw that my
life had not that blithesomeness that would have
been natural to me, and which she would have
been glad to give it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>It was the presence and influence of the mother-in-law
that gave a chill to my home life, and yet I
could accuse the good woman of no special offence.
She was no vulgar meddler, and never wished or
intended to mar our domestic felicity. She had
managed to keep control of our household arrangements
and we had passively acquiesced, but I felt
that it would be better if Bessie would take command
and cater more to our own desires. We
could then have things our own way, and her
position would be more becoming as the lady of
the house. She began to regard it in the same
light herself. Our social life, too, had been restrained
and restricted. I was very fond of having
my friends about me, and wished them to come
in for the evening or to dinner or to pass a Sunday
afternoon in our little bower, as often as they
could find it agreeable. Mrs. Pinkerton made no
open objections, but I knew the company of my
friends was not congenial to her, and so was reluctant
and backward in my invitations to them.
Besides, they were apt to be chilled and disconcerted
by the widow&#8217;s stately presence and rebuking
ways, and were disinclined to make themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>quite at home with us. Fred Marston and
his wife had been quite driven away. Mrs. Pinkerton
had declined to speak to the latter, and
had told the former in plain terms that he used
language of which no gentleman would be guilty.</p>

<p>&#8220;By thunder!&#8221; roared the impulsive fellow, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
have you to understand that my wife and I are
just as good as you, with your cursed airs of superiority!&#8221;
and he stormed out of doors, and incontinently
returned to town. When I met him afterwards
he condescendingly declared that he didn&#8217;t
blame me, except that I ought to be a man and not
allow &#8220;old Pink&#8221; to insult my guests. I did not
particularly regret his discontinuing his visits, for,
to tell the truth, I did not like his manners, and
he had drifted into a circle and among associates
not at all to my taste, but it galled me to have
any one whom I chose to entertain driven out of
my house.</p>

<p>I think nothing saved our charming friend, Miss
Van Duzen, to whom we had both become greatly
attached, from being gracefully snubbed and insulted,
except the presence of her uncle, whenever
she came out to visit us in the evening. Mr. Desmond&#8217;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>indisputable social rank, his unimpeachable
demeanor as a gentleman, and the dignity and
impressiveness of his presence, though it could by
no means overawe my mother-in-law, made it impossible
even for her to give him an affront.
Besides, she seemed to have a real respect for
that fine old gentleman. She would doubtless
have thought better of him if he had been a regular
attendant at St. Thomas&#8217;s Church, but she could
not learn that he was very constant at any sanctuary.
His views were decidedly what are called
liberal, and yet he was very considerate of the religious
beliefs and practices of others, and would
cheerfully acknowledge the worthy aims and good
works of all the different Christian denominations.
He seemed to understand why other persons should
choose to join one or another, while he preferred
to stand aloof, have his own ways of thinking, and
do whatever good he might in his own way. He
had large business interests and great wealth, and
though he maintained his mansion in the city in
great elegance, his family expenses were comparatively
small, and he was reputed to make it up
fully by supporting more than one poor family in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>a quiet way. He was liberal in his conduct as
well as his belief, and his character and habits
were above the reproach of the severest critic.
Hence it was that the widow was forced to respect
at least this one of our visitors, and to treat his
niece with common civility, though cordiality was
out of the question.</p>

<p>In fact, we owed to Mr. Desmond not a little
for what relief we obtained in our social life
from the chilling restraints of the mother-in-law&#8217;s
presence. He seemed to take a real pleasure in
coming out to our little snuggery. His stately
establishment in town could not be very home-like.
His niece presided over it with great skill,
and saw that every wish or taste of his was gratified.
She could always entertain him with her
sprightly wit, and their social occasions were
among the most elegant in the city. He had his
club to go to, which furnished every means that
ingenuity and lavish resources could contrive to
minister to the pleasures of man. And yet, there
was wanting to his life that element that was
the essence of home. He had longed for it when
he was young, and had provided for it in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>household; but the wife of his youth had been
called from him early, and he had vainly tried to
fill all his life with business, with silent works of
charity, with elegance and profusion in his house,
with his clubs, his studies, and his travels; but
still there was a void, and when he came to visit
us, he seemed to find something akin to the home
feeling in our little circle. So he came far oftener
than was to be expected of one in his position.
Clara was his excuse, but it was plain to see that
he liked to come on his own account, and he made
himself very agreeable to us all; and when he
came, we noticed the chilling influence of Mrs.
Pinkerton much less than when he was not there.</p>

<p>Sometimes we had a whist party. It was
generally Bessie and I against Clara and George,
but the widow had no objection to whist and was
occasionally induced to take a hand, while Mr.
Desmond was quite fond of the game and was a
consummate player. When we young people
made up the set, Mr. Desmond would converse
with the widow, for though reticent where politeness
did not call upon him to talk, he was incapable
of the rudeness of sitting silent with one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>other person, or in a small party of intimate
friends; and these conversations, showing his
wide information on all manner of subjects, his
sympathy with all charitable movements, and his
tolerant regard even for the widow&#8217;s pet ideas
on church and society, evidently increased her
respect for him.</p>

<p>George must not be forgotten as a member of
our circle, and never can be by those who were in
it. His vivacity did much to relieve us from the
depression that brooded over us. He and Clara
Van, as he had taken to calling her as a sort of
play upon caravan,&mdash;for was she not a whole
team in herself? he would say,&mdash;he and Clara had
many a lively contest of words, and were well
matched in their powers of wit and repartee.</p>

<p>Thus there were lights as well as shades,
relief as well as depression, in our social life, but
over it all was a shadow, the shadow of my
mother-in-law.</p>

<span class="caption">MY MOTHER-IN-LAW SUBDUED.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s</span> I was saying, I made up my mind that our
happiness was marred by habitual submission
to mother-in-law, and I determined to shake
off the nightmare, to assert myself, and to reduce
that stately crown of gray puffs to a subordinate
place. How was I to do it? There was nothing
that I could make the cause of direct complaint,
and it was hard to get into a downright conflict
which would involve plain speaking. I consulted
with Bessie, and she agreed with me, and promised
to assume the direction of household affairs. She
did not like to hurt her mother&#8217;s feelings, but she
admitted that it was best for her to be mistress.
I could but admire the matronly firmness and tact
with which she played her part. She gave her
orders and told her mother what she proposed to
do, and then proceeded to execute it as if there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>was no room for question. If opposition was
made, she very quietly and firmly insisted. Her
mother was astonished and had some warm words,
in which she accused me of trying to set her
daughter against her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Bessie, &#8220;Charlie does not wish to
set me against you or to have you made unhappy,
but he thinks it better that I should be the mistress
here, and I quite agree with him, and propose
henceforth to be the mistress.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow was not offended, but hurt. She
had too much good sense not to see the propriety
of our decision, and she surrendered and tried
not to appear affected.</p>

<p>This was the first victory. Another time, at
the table, she had exercised her prescriptive right
of extinguishing me for some remark of which she
did not approve. I fired up and remarked, &#8220;I
have the right to speak my own opinion in my
own house, Mrs. Pinkerton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly you have a right to speak your own
opinion in your own house,&#8221; she replied, with
the least little sarcastic emphasis on &#8220;your own
house,&#8221; which cut me to the quick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t seem to think so,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;You have had a way of snubbing me and putting
me down which I don&#8217;t propose to tolerate
any longer. I am master of my own conduct and
of my own household, and I hope, in future, that
my liberty may not be interfered with.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow&#8217;s lip quivered, her great eyes moistened,
and she left the table, not because she was
offended, but to hide her injured feelings. I felt
mean, and would have apologized, but that I felt
that my cause was at stake. There was no after-explanation.
My mother-in-law came and went
about the house as usual, calm and polite. A silly
woman would have refused to speak to me for
some weeks; but she was not a silly woman, and
took pains to speak with the most studied politeness,
and to avoid offence. Here, too, she had
evidently surrendered.</p>

<p>This was victory number two. One more and
the battle was won. It was a Sunday in June.
I had especially invited Mr. Desmond and his
niece to come out to dinner and to spend the
afternoon, and had insisted to Fred Marston
that he should come with his wife. I wanted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>vindicate my right to have what friends I pleased,
and then I didn&#8217;t care overmuch if I never saw
him again. Mrs. Pinkerton had gone to church
alone as usual. For some weeks Bessie had been
unable to accompany her, and I preferred the
sanctuary at which the scholarly, but heterodox,
Mr. Freeman preached. When she returned, our
guests had arrived. She put on her eye-glasses
as she entered the gate, and looked about with
evident disapproval, as we were scattered over the
lawn. She did not believe in Sunday visits. She
was even stiff and distant to Mr. Desmond, and
refused to see the Marstons at all, though they
were directly before her eyes. She walked
straight into the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove,&#8221; said George to me in an undertone,
&#8220;that isn&#8217;t right! I shall speak to mother about
cutting your guests in that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;don&#8217;t you say a
word; I want an opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw it in a minute, and acquiesced with a
queer smile. He fully sympathized with me, and
had even encouraged me in the work of emancipation.
He had the utmost respect and affection for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>his mother, but he said it was not right for her to
make my home unpleasant.</p>

<p>That Sunday Mrs. Pinkerton joined us at the
dinner-table. I knew she would not be guilty of
the incivility of staying away.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember my friends, Mr. and Mrs. Marston?&#8221;
I said, by way of introduction, as she came
in.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember them very well,&#8221; was the reply;
&#8220;too well,&#8221; the tone implied. I made a special
effort to be talkative, and to keep others talking
during the dinner. It was very hard work, and
I met with indifferent success. It was not a pleasant
dinner. Mr. Desmond alone appeared not to
mind the restraint, and he alone ventured to
address the widow. She was polite, but far from
sociable. We contrived to pass the afternoon
tolerably, but not at all in the spirit which I
wished to have prevail when I had friends to visit
me, and all because of that presence.</p>

<p>After they were gone, I took occasion to introduce
the subject, for I had learned that Mrs.
Pinkerton&#8217;s skill in expressing her disapproval in
her manner was so great that she relied on it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>almost altogether, and rarely resorted to words
for the purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you did not enjoy the company
very much to-day,&#8221; I said, as we were sitting in
the little parlor, overlooking an exquisite flower
garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; she answered, with the old emphasis
on the &#8220;sir.&#8221; &#8220;I do not approve of company on
the Sabbath, and I had hoped you would never
again bring those Marstons into my presence at
any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, madam; but I propose to be my
own judge of whom I shall invite to visit me, and
of the time and occasion. I presume you admit
my right to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, sir. I never disputed it, and had
no intention of saying anything if you had not
introduced the subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I introduced the subject for the very purpose;
in fact, I brought out the company for the very
purpose of vindicating my right, and it would be
very gratifying to me if you would concede it
cheerfully, and not, by your manner and way of
treating my friends, interfere with it hereafter.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>I was almost astonished at my own courage
and spirit, and still more so at Mrs. Pinkerton&#8217;s
reply. It was dusky and I could not see her face,
but her voice trembled and choked as she answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;God knows I do not wish to interfere with
your happiness. Bessie&#8217;s happiness has been my
one thought for years, and now it is bound up
with yours. I have my own notions, which I cannot
easily discard, but I would not do or say anything
that would mar your enjoyment for the
world. I have long felt that I did do so, and
have made up my mind to make any sacrifice of
pride and inclination to avoid it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here she actually broke down and sobbed, and
I was very near joining her. &#8220;Never mind,&#8221; I
said at length, quite softened; &#8220;I guess we shall
get along pleasantly together in the future, now
that we have an understanding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; she said, recovering her serenity,
and we relapsed into a painful silence.</p>

<p>This was the third and final victory, but I felt
no elation over it. My mother-in-law receded
somewhat into the background, but it was so much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>in sorrow, rather than anger, that I felt her new
mood almost as depressing as the old. I didn&#8217;t
want her to feel injured or subdued, but evidently
she couldn&#8217;t help it, and the mother-in-law,
though conquered, was herself still, and that congeniality
that would make our life together wholly
pleasant was impossible. Her existence was still
a shadow, less chilling and more pensive, but a
shadow in our home, and it seemed destined to
stay there.</p>

<span class="caption">GEORGE&#8217;S NEW DEPARTURE.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="floatleft">&#8220;</span><span class="dropcap">G</span>eorge</span> is growing very restless. I don&#8217;t
know what ails him,&#8221; Bessie said to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can guess,&#8221; I said, looking wise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember what an uneasy, good-for-nothing
chap one Charlie Travers was, when he
first began to call on a certain young woman with
conspicuous regularity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Charlie, you don&#8217;t think he&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! Now don&#8217;t explode too suddenly.
I wouldn&#8217;t have him know that I suspect anything
for the world. We won&#8217;t name any names, but I
keep my eyes about me, and I flatter myself I
know the symptoms.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with these mysterious words, I started for
the bank, leaving to Bessie a new and delightful
subject for speculation and air-castle building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>George did not come home to supper that day,
but that was nothing extraordinary. I was sitting
out on the porch, smoking after the meal, and
saw him coming up the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; I asked, as he joined
me and took a seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;None of your business. In town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Miss Van well?&#8221; I asked mischievously.</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, George, you don&#8217;t play the part of
Innocence over well. Suppose you try Candor,
and tell me where you have been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mistake my identity. I&#8217;m not your
baby. You will find the youthful Charlie entertaining
his mother up stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long-drawn-out, agonized wail, proceeding
from the regions above, showed how Bessie was
being entertained.</p>

<p>&#8220;No opening yet?&#8221; I ventured to ask, changing
the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the slightest prospect. If some of these
doctors could only be inveigled into taking some
of their own prescriptions! But no; they are too
wise.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>&#8220;The bitterness of your tone would seem to
indicate that you have not enjoyed your visit to
the town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The town be hanged, and the country too!
Let&#8217;s take a walk down the street. Give me a
cigar, confound you! How hot it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>We strolled down the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a terrible vale of tears, this world,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;The world is hollow, and my doll is
stuffed with sawdust, which accounts for his howling.&#8221;</p>

<p>George was silent. He pulled at his cigar ferociously,
smoked it half up, threw it away, and
replaced it by a cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;When a man throws away the best part of
a Reina Victoria he is either flush or badly in
love,&#8221; said I to myself. I waited patiently for
him to speak, as I was perfectly willing to
receive his confidence, but I didn&#8217;t have the
chance. He maintained a loud silence all the
way, and we walked back home as we had gone
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s up&mdash;something serious,&#8221; I informed
Bessie that night, &#8220;but George does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>confide in me worth a cent, which I think is a little
unbrotherly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following day George was absent from an
early hour in the afternoon till long after all the
household were fast asleep at night. I was awakened
at about midnight by a light tapping at the
door of our room, and slipped out of bed without
disturbing Bessie or the baby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come up to my den!&#8221; whispered George, as
I opened the door. &#8220;Don&#8217;t wake the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>I quietly got into my clothes and crawled noiselessly
up to George&#8217;s &#8220;den,&#8221; devoured by curiosity.
The moment I caught sight of his handsome face
I saw that it was all right with him, and that he
had nothing but good news to tell me. We sat
down, hoisted our heels to a comfortable altitude,
and George told his story. I let him tell it himself
here:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was feeling terribly blue yesterday, when
you saw me,&#8221; he began, &#8220;as you could see. In
the afternoon I went into town, and, according to
a previous arrangement, hired a horse and buggy
and called to take her out riding.&#8221;</p>

<p>(Of course &#8220;her&#8221; was Miss Van.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>&#8220;We had agreed to take the old Linwood road,
and follow it to the village, returning through the
Maplewood Park and so getting back to the city
at about six. We left the town and passed
through the suburbs rapidly, until we struck into
the country, and there I let the horse go his own
pace, which was slow. So much the better.
Miss Van Duzen was never more charming. We
had the most agreeable bit of talk, and she drew
me out till I amazed myself. She always does.
It&#8217;s no use my telling you, Charlie, but I have
been a fool in my love for her ever since the night
she came into this cottage like a stray beam of
sunshine on a cloudy day. My heart went out of
my keeping the night she called here with the old
gentleman. I believe it was her freshness, her
moral purity, that acted on my morbid, half <i>blas&eacute;</i>
spirit, like a tonic, and brought me on my feet.
I&#8217;m talking random nonsense, you say, but why
shouldn&#8217;t I? I&#8217;m drunk with love. Don&#8217;t laugh
at me. I&#8217;ll be all right by daylight, except a
headache. We got to talking about ourselves.
Lovers always do, don&#8217;t they? You ought to
know. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be much else in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>the world worth talking about. I told her all
about myself,&mdash;my past, with its good and bad
points, and my present hopes and purposes. It
all popped out as naturally as possible. I suppose
it would sound like drivel if I were to
repeat it. Finally she began to laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is dangerous to make a woman your confidant,&#8217;
she said. &#8216;How do you know that I can
keep a secret better than any other of my sex?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am not afraid on that score,&#8217; said I. &#8216;This
is my confessional. It is as sacred as any. Am
I to receive absolution?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;She could not fully promise that. She read
me a neat little lecture. It was fascinating to
thus receive correction at her hands. I pledged
myself, when it was done, to follow the course
laid out for me. Then I made bold to exchange
<i>r&ocirc;les</i>. With some maidenly hesitation, which
soon vanished, she in turn laid before me the
inner history of her life. Ah, my boy, how little
there was in it to gloss over! how much to humiliate
the best and noblest of us men! It was a
revelation that made me prostrate myself before
her. I was not worthy to hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>George paused, and drummed on the table with
his fingers nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may as well tell you all,&#8221; he resumed. &#8220;I
had resolved to ask that girl to marry me when
we started on our ride, but after what she said to
me so simply and modestly, I positively could not
do it. She expected me to speak, I know that,
for she would not have told me what she did tell
me, otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you didn&#8217;t speak? Oh, stupid, stupid
boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it. But my tongue was tied. Perhaps
it was all cowardice; I can&#8217;t say. I never
was afraid of any one before. I came home
utterly shattered and down-hearted. To-day I
gravitated back to her, after a sleepless night.
She received me with the same friendly smile as
usual, but there seemed to be a slight shadow
over her spirits. That little, almost imperceptible
change filled me with joy. I jumped to a conclusion
that intoxicated me, and made the plunge
at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is another case of the moth and the candle,&#8217;
I said to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>&#8220;&#8216;Thank you. So I am a candle? That is a
fine figure of speech.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Seriously speaking, I think we had not finished
what we were talking of yesterday.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What were we talking of yesterday?&#8217; she
had the effrontery to ask. &#8216;Oh, yes, now I recollect.
It was yourself. That subject, I fear, you
will never finish talking of.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now that&#8217;s a very mean speech, all things
considered,&#8217; I whined. &#8216;Do you want to strike a
man, when he&#8217;s way down?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t play Uriah Heep. I hate &#8217;umble people.
But if I have perchance pierced the thick
epidermis of Parisian pride you have so long
worn, I&#8217;m glad of it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;She likes to abuse me, and I enjoy it quite as
well as she. She continued to scold me and mock
me for some time, to disguise her actual mood.
I saw through it, and let her have her way for
a while. The meeker my replies, the greater the
exaggerated harshness of her criticisms. At last
I no longer attempted to reply at all. Leaning
back in a corner of the sofa, I watched the play
of her animated features and the light of her dark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>brown eyes, and felt that she was the one woman
in the universe that suited me, the one woman I
could respect and love passionately at the same
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You say truly I am a coward. I am aware
of that. I admit that I am all that is detestable.
If such a wretch as you describe were to love a
woman, what unhappiness for him! There could
be no hope for him. He would know his own
irredeemable unworthiness, and so could only
slink away in shame.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You are quite right,&#8217; she cried, laughing merrily.
&#8216;That would be the only course for him to
pursue.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;By the way,&#8217; I said, &#8216;that reminds me that
my train goes out in twenty minutes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I rose, and she also stood up to accompany me
to the door. I held out my hand. It was an
unusual demonstration, and perhaps she thought
it meant good-by in earnest. At least, as she
put her hand in mine, I detected a look I had
never before seen in the depths of those fine
eyes. With a sudden, unpremeditated, and irresistible
movement, I drew her close to me, folded
my arms about her, and kissed her passionately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>&#8220;&#8216;Clara!&#8217; I whispered, &#8216;I love you! I love
you! Don&#8217;t tell me to go.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;She gently drew herself out of my reluctant
arms, and though her eyes were misty now, I saw
in them that I was to stay.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all the story I have to tell you, Charlie.
I am too happy to-night to sleep, so I couldn&#8217;t
let you sleep. I stayed and spent the evening.
Mr. Desmond, bless his dear old heart! cried over
Clara, and gave her an old-fashioned blessing.
I walked home on air. Do I look very badly
corned?&#8221;</p>

<p>I gave him a rousing hand-shake, and wiped
away a stray bit of moisture from my cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I tell Bessie?&#8221; were my first words when
I found my tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? There will be no long engagement
in this case. The knot shall be tied as soon as
possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>The announcement I made to my little wife the
following morning was not entirely unexpected,
yet it filled her with delight. Miss Van was the
woman of all others that Bessie wished to have
George marry. The arrangement was, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>completely to her satisfaction, and she beamed
upon the happy George with true sisterly affection.</p>

<p>What effect would the news have upon Mrs.
Pinkerton? I asked myself. I had not long to
wait for an answer, for it was at the breakfast-table
that George fired the shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said the bold youth, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
be married.&#8221;</p>

<p>His mother abruptly stopped stirring her coffee,
and her spine visibly stiffened, but she said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;The event will occur without delay. Of course
it is useless to inform you who is the&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite useless,&#8221; Mrs. Pinkerton broke in; &#8220;my
wishes in the matter are not of the slightest consequence
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary. Now, look here; don&#8217;t be
so infernally quick to anticipate my wilfulness. I
want to conform to your wishes if I can. <i>Que
faire?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will talk about it after breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly, there was a serious passage-at-arms
in the library after breakfast. George left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>the house a conqueror, but the conquered had no
sort of intention of abandoning the campaign after
a Bull Run defeat. In fact, war had only just
been declared. It must not be supposed that it
was a war the movements of which could be followed
by the acutest military observer; the batteries
were all masked, but the gunpowder was
there. I felt confident that George would carry
everything before him, and he did. He brought
Miss Van over to spend the evening, and we had
the pleasantest time imaginable. He would not
allow his mother to say a word against Miss Van,
and made a fair show of proving that the latter
had, not only better blood, but also better breeding
and a truer sense of propriety than my mother-in-law,
that is, &#8220;when it came to the scratch,&#8221; as
George said. &#8220;But who would give a snap for a
young woman who can&#8217;t throw aside the shackles
of conventionality once in a while, and be herself?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Van was her own jolliest, sweetest self at
this time. Her beauty had never been so noticeable:
joy is an excellent cosmetic, and love paints
far better than rouge or powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>As soon as Mrs. Pinkerton had recovered from
her defeat, and when the engagement had become
an acknowledged fact which all the world
might know, the wedding began to loom up
before us, and I could not help wondering if St.
Thomas&#8217;s Church was to be the scene of as fashionable
and grand a display as on the occasion
when Bessie and myself were made one.</p>

<p>I felt reasonably certain that Mrs. Pinkerton
would make an effort to that end, and I was curious
to see how George would look on it.</p>

<p>Bessie, I think, would have been glad to see the
marriage take place with as much pomp and show
as possible. She was intensely interested in what
Clara should wear, and every visit from that young
woman was the occasion for a vast deal of confidential
and no doubt highly important <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
consultation.</p>

<p>Mother-in-law sailed into the library one evening
with unusual celerity of movement.</p>

<p>&#8220;George, dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;this cannot be true!
You would not permit such an eccentric, uncivilized
proceeding. Surely you will not offend our
friends by&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>&#8220;Avast there! Our friends be hanged!&#8221; cried
George wickedly. &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s true, too true. The
ceremony will be private, and no cards. You can
come, though! Next Wednesday, at two o&#8217;clock,
sharp!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was cruel. I could see his mother almost
stagger under the blow. She attempted to remonstrate,
but it was too late. George assured her
that &#8220;it was all fixed,&#8221; and that Clara had agreed
with him regarding the details.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honest old John Stephens will tie the knot,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;and it will be just as tight as if Dr.
McCanon manipulated the holy bonds. I trust we
shall have the pleasure of your company, mother.
Consider yourself invited. A few of the choicest
spirits will be on hand. Clara will wear the most
exquisite gray travelling suit you ever laid eyes
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow was flanked, outgeneralled, routed
along the whole line. She brought forward all
her reserve forces of good-breeding, and thus
escaped a disastrous panic by retiring in good
order.</p>

<p>The ceremony occurred, as George had announced,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>the following Wednesday. The near
relatives and best friends of the young couple
were present, and it was a quiet and thoroughly
enjoyable affair for all who participated. An
hour after they had been pronounced man and
wife, George and his bride rode away to take the
train for the mountains.</p>

<span class="caption">BABY TALK, OLD DIVES, AND OTHER THINGS.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> cottage seemed dull enough after the
departure of George with his bride. Bessie
was so absorbed by the care of our little one that
she had very little time to think of anything else,
and in fact the new-comer, for the time being,
monopolized the attention of his grandmother as
well as of his mother. I was therefore left to my
own resources.</p>

<p>&#8220;Baby is not very well, Charlie,&#8221; Bessie informed
me, one morning, with an anxious air.
&#8220;Do you think it would do to wrap him up well
and take him for a little ride this afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s a good idea. If I can get that
black horse at the livery stable, I&#8217;ll bring him
around this afternoon. But I don&#8217;t see why you
should wrap him up. It&#8217;s hot as blazes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know anything about babies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>Charlie. Go along. Get a nice, easy carriage,
and we&#8217;ll take mother with us. I long for a ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>I departed, and secured the desired &#8220;team.&#8221;</p>

<p>Towards two o&#8217;clock I drove up to the cottage,
and the entire family bundled into the vehicle,
and we were off. I chose a pleasant, shady road,
and drove slowly, while Bessie and her mother
filled the air with baby talk.</p>

<p>As we were climbing the hill near Linwood, I
saw, a short distance ahead of us, the form of an
elderly gentleman toiling up the ascent in the sun.
He seemed fatigued, and stopped as we drew near
him, to wipe the beads of perspiration from his
brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Mr. Desmond!&#8221; exclaimed Bessie.</p>

<p>Sure enough! As he turned toward us I recognized
the white vest, the expansive shirt-front, and
the resplendent watch-chain that could belong to
no other than &#8220;old Dives&#8221; himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;How d&#8217;ye do?&#8221; I cried, halting our fiery steed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Mr. Travers, Mrs. Pinkerton, how do you
do? Delighted to meet you. It&#8217;s very warm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How came you so far out in the country
afoot?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>&#8220;I had some business at Melton, and lost the
2:30 train back to town, so I started to walk to
Linwood with the purpose of taking a train on the
other road. They told me it was only a mile and
a half, but&mdash;.&#8221; And he sighed significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How fortunate that we met you,&#8221; said Mrs.
Pinkerton quickly, taking the words out of my
mouth. &#8220;Get in and ride to Linwood with us.
We have a vacant seat, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>I seconded her invitation, and without much
hesitation he accepted, and took a seat by my
side. The conversation turned naturally upon the
&#8220;young couple&#8221; (Bessie and I were no longer
referred to in that way), and Mr. Desmond
extolled his niece unreservedly. Mother-in-law
was evidently somewhat impressed, but I think
she made some mental reservations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you smoke, Mr. Desmond?&#8221; I asked,
offering him a cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I had forgotten you did not approve of
the habit. Excuse me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Pinkerton explained to Mr. Desmond, apologetically,
that I was an irresponsible victim of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>nicotine poison. I laughed, but Mr. Desmond
received the explanation solemnly, and expressed
his abhorrence for &#8220;the weed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old gentleman professed great admiration
for baby, and said that he looked exactly like his
mother; in fact, the resemblance was almost startling.</p>

<p>By the time we had got to Linwood, our passenger
had talked himself into a state of good-humor,
and we left him at the railroad station,
bowing and smiling with true old-school <i>aplomb</i>.</p>

<p>Bessie thought the ride did Charlie, junior,
good, and so it became a regular thing, on pleasant
afternoons, to take him out for a little airing.
Mrs. Pinkerton overcame her scruples, and usually
accompanied us. A sample of the sweet
converse held with my son and heir on the back
seat will suffice:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sodywazzaleetlecatchykums! &#8216;Esoodavaboobangy!
Mamma&#8217;s cunnin&#8217; kitten-baby!&#8221;</p>

<p>One day, just before noon, when I had been
making a mental calculation as to how I should be
able to cover the livery-stable bill, a fine equipage
stopped in front of the bank, and through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>window I saw the stately driver hand a note to
our errand-boy. In a moment Tommy appeared
in the room and handed me the billet, which ran
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Travers</span>,&mdash;I trust you will not take
it amiss if I send my coachman out your way once in a
while to exercise the ponies. Since Clara&#8217;s taking-off,
they have stood still too much, and knowing that you go to
ride occasionally with your family, I take the liberty of
putting them at your disposal for the present, with instructions
to John, who is a careful and trustworthy
driver, to place himself at your service whenever you are
so disposed. The obligation will be entirely on my part,
if you will kindly take a turn behind the ponies whenever
you choose. My regards to your wife and Mrs. Pinkerton.</p>

<p class="sigline1">Believe me yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">T. G. Desmond</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>I could find no objection to accepting this
kindly offer, so delicately made, but I did not
dare to do so before consulting Bessie and her
mother, so I stepped into the carriage and had
John drive me to the cottage. There was a consultation,
and after I had overcome some feeble
scruples on Mrs. Pinkerton&#8217;s part, which I am
afraid were hypocritical, we decided to take
advantage of Mr. Desmond&#8217;s generosity. I sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>a note of thanks back by John, and thenceforth
we took our rides behind &#8220;old Dives&#8217;s&#8221; black
ponies. Occasionally the old gentleman himself
came out in the carriage, and proved himself as
trustworthy and careful a driver as John, handling
the &#8220;ribbons&#8221; with the air of an accomplished
whip. The rides were very pleasant, those beautiful
summer days, and the change from a hired
&#8220;team&#8221; to the sumptuous establishment of Mr.
Desmond was extremely grateful.</p>

<p>Mr. Desmond was doubtless very lonely without
his niece. She had been the light of his home,
and her absence was probably felt by the old gentleman
with more keenness than he had anticipated
at the outset. His large and beautifully furnished
mansion needed the presence of just such a person
of vivacious and cheery character as Clara, to
prevent it from becoming cheerless in its grandeur.
He intimated as much, and appeared unusually
restless and low-spirited for him. He sought to
make up for the absence of the sunshine and joyousness
that &#8220;Miss Van&#8221; had taken away with her,
by applying himself with especial diligence to
business; but he really had not much business to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>engross his attention, beyond collecting his interest
and looking out for his agents, and it failed to
fill the void. He betook himself to his club, and
killed time assiduously, talking with the men-about-town
he found there, playing whist, and
running through the magazines and reviews in
search of wit and wisdom wherewith to divert himself.
The dull season had set in; there was little
doing, in affairs, commerce, politics, or literature;
and direct efforts at killing time always result in
making time go more heavily than ever. Mr.
Desmond&#8217;s attempt was like a curious <i>pas seul</i>,
executed by a nimble actor in a certain extravaganza,
the peculiarity of which is that at every
forward step the dancer slides farther and farther
backward, until finally an unseen power appears
to drag him back into the flies.</p>

<p>It was during one of our afternoon drives, when
Mr. Desmond usurped the office of his coachman,
that he confided to us a plan which he had devised
to cure his <i>ennui</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have made up my mind,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to go
abroad for a good long tour. It will be the best
move I could possibly make.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it,&#8221; I said. &#8220;How soon do you
propose to go?&#8221; And Bessie sighed, &#8220;O dear,
how delightful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My plans are not matured,&#8221; Mr. Desmond continued,
&#8220;but I think I shall sail early next month.
My favorite steamer leaves on the 6th.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will enjoy a pleasant voyage, and
a delightful trip on the other side,&#8221; said Mrs.
Pinkerton politely.</p>

<p>Mr. Desmond returned thanks. Nothing more
was said that day concerning his project. When
he left us at the cottage, he remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, Mr. Travers, I wish you would
call at my office to-morrow morning at or about
eleven o&#8217;clock, if you can make it convenient to
do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do so,&#8221; I replied, wondering what he
could want of me.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour the next day I was on
hand at his office. He motioned to me to be seated
and then said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesterday morning I met John K. Blunt, of
Blunt Brothers &amp; Company, at my club, and he
told me that their cashier had defaulted. An account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>of the affair is in this morning&#8217;s papers.
They want a new cashier. I have mentioned your
name, and if you will go around to their office
with me, we will talk with Blunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Desmond&mdash;&#8221; I began, but he stopped
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s have any talk but business,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;The figures will be satisfactory, I am confident.&#8221;</p>

<p>Satisfactory! They were munificent! Blunt
liked me, and only a few short and sharp sentences
from such a man as Desmond finished
the business. I saw a future of opulence before
me. My head was almost turned. I tried to
thank Mr. Desmond, but he would not listen to my
earnest expressions of gratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have engaged passage for the 6th,&#8221; he told
me when we were parting; &#8220;I will try to call at
your cottage before I get off. I am busy settling
up some details now. Good day.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hastened home with my good news. Bessie&#8217;s
eyes glistened when she heard it, and even my
mother-in-law showed a faint sign of pleasure at
my good luck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>The following Saturday evening Mr. Desmond
came out to see us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t consider this my farewell appearance,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I merely wished to tell you that my
friends have inveigled me into giving an informal
party Tuesday evening, at which I shall expect
you all to appear.&#8221;</p>

<p>He talked glibly, for him, and gave us an outline
sketch of his proposed tour. I thought he
seemed strangely restless and nervous, and I
pitied him.</p>

<p>His &#8220;informal party&#8221; was really a noteworthy
affair, and the wealth and respectability of the
city were well represented. Bessie could not go,
on account of the baby, so I acted as escort to
Mrs. Pinkerton, who made herself amazingly
agreeable. There were not many young people
present, and the affair was quiet and genteel in the
extreme. Bank presidents, capitalists, professional
men, and &#8220;solid&#8221; men, with their wives, attired in
black silks, formed the majority of the guests.
They were Mr. Desmond&#8217;s personal friends. My
mother-in-law was in congenial company, and I
believe she enjoyed the evening remarkably.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>Most of the conversation turned, very naturally,
upon European travel. Americans who are possessed
of wealth always have done &#8220;the grand
tour,&#8221; and they invariably speak of &#8220;Europe&#8221; in
a general way, as if it were all one country.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I returned from my first tour abroad, a
friend said to me that he &#8216;supposed it was a fine
country over there,&#8217;&#8221; said Mr. Desmond to me,
laughing.</p>

<p>Some one asked him where he had decided to
go.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall land at Havre, and go straight to
Paris,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I flatter myself I am a
good American, and as I have been comparatively
dead since my niece left me, I am entitled to a
place in that terrestrial paradise.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought I had never seen Mrs. Pinkerton
appear to so good advantage as she did on this
occasion. Her natural good manners and her
intelligence made her attractive in such a company,
and she was the centre of a bright group of
middle-aged Brahmins throughout the entire evening.
Mr. Desmond appeared grateful for the
assistance she rendered in making his party pass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>off pleasantly, and as for me, I began to feel that
I had never quite appreciated her best qualities.
She was a woman that one could not wholly know
in a year, perhaps not in a lifetime. &#8220;Who
knows?&#8221; I thought; &#8220;perhaps I have wronged
my mother-in-law.&#8221;</p>

<span class="caption">A SURPRISE.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>e</span> were feeling a little solemn at the cottage.
George, with his lively ways, and Clara,
with her sparkling vivacity, were away on their
wedding tour, and our good friend, Mr. Desmond,
to whom we had taken a great liking, was about
to sail for an indefinite absence in foreign lands.
Though the mother-in-law&#8217;s presence was less
oppressive than formerly, there was now a pensiveness,
an air of departed glory about it, that
was not cheerful. There was danger of settling
down to a humdrum sort of life, free from strife,
perhaps, but at the same time devoid of that buoyancy
which should make the home of a young
couple joyous.</p>

<p>I was a little doubtful of making a vacation in
the country this summer. To be sure, when
George went away, it was agreed that after he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>had gone the round of the White Mountains, the
attractions of Canada, Niagara Falls, and Saratoga,
he would return for a quiet stay of a few
weeks, at the close of the season, to the little
resort which we had visited a year ago, and there,
if Bessie&#8217;s health would permit, and I could
arrange for a sufficient absence from business, we
would join them. But I almost dreaded taking
Mrs. Pinkerton with us, and doubted whether she
would go; at the same time, I did not like to
propose leaving her behind to take care of the
cottage. I was in perplexity, and, notwithstanding
my splendid new prospects in business, was
not feeling cheerful.</p>

<p>Coming home from a restless round of the city
on the Fourth of July, where I had found the great
national holiday a bore, I noticed Mr. Desmond&#8217;s
team coming up to the garden gate with a brisk
turn. That fine old gentleman&mdash;I always feel
like calling him old on account of his gray whiskers,
though he was little more than fifty&mdash;came down
the walk and with stately politeness assisted Bessie
and the baby out of the carriage. I looked to see
Mrs. Pinkerton follow, but she was not there, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>clearly Mr. Desmond had not been to ride. It
struck me as a little queer, not to say amusing,
that they had been having a quiet <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
together in the cottage while John gave Bessie and
the baby their airing. But then, it was not so
strange either, for was he not going to leave us in
two days? It was no uncommon thing for Mrs.
Pinkerton to stay within while Bessie was out, and
he had probably dropped in late in the afternoon,
expecting to find us all at home, as it was a holiday.
I bade him good by in case I did not see
him again, as he got into the carriage to ride back
to the city.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I shall see you to-morrow,&#8221; he said in a
brisk tone which had not been habitual with him
of late.</p>

<p>That evening my mother-in-law was uncommonly
gracious, a little absent-minded, and more
pleasant in spirit than I had ever known her.
She seemed to be filled with an inward satisfaction
that I could not make out at all. Bessie and I
both remarked it, but could not surmise any
cause for the apparent change that had come over
the spirit of her dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>Next morning, on reaching town, I found a
note asking me to step over to Mr. Desmond&#8217;s
office when I could find time. I went at my leisure,
wondering what was up. As I entered, he
seemed remarkably cordial and happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I find that Blunt,&#8221; he said in a business-like
way, &#8220;would like to have you take hold at once, if
possible. Their affairs are in some confusion and
need an experienced hand to straighten them out.
It will be necessary for you to give a bond, which
I have here all prepared, with satisfactory sureties,
and you need only give us your signature, which
I will have properly witnessed on the spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is that it?&#8221; I thought. Strange I didn&#8217;t
think of its having something to do with my new
position. I knew I could get away from my
old place at a week&#8217;s notice, as I had already
made known my intention to leave, and there
were several applicants for the position. The
bond was executed without hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not lose your vacation,&#8221; Mr. Desmond
said, &#8220;though your salary will begin at
once. As soon as you can get matters in order,
which may take a month or more, you are to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>allowed a few weeks&#8217; absence to recuperate and
get fully prepared for your new responsibilities.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thanking him for his kindness, I was about to
go, when he said, &#8220;Sit down, Mr. Travers. I
have something else to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s coming now?&#8221; I wondered, as I took
my seat again. Mr. Desmond seemed a little at
a loss how to begin his new communication, and
came nearer appearing embarrassed than I should
have thought possible for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;I have changed
my mind about going abroad.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have no doubt I looked very much surprised
and puzzled, and smiling at the expression of my
face, he went on,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother-in-law, Mrs. Pinkerton, is a very
worthy woman; in fact, a remarkably worthy
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t deny that; but why should he choose
such a time and place to compliment her?</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he added, with a still nearer
approach to embarrassment in his manner, and
something like a blush on his usually calm face,
&#8220;I have asked her to become Mrs. Desmond.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>&#8220;The devil you have!&#8221; was my thought as
astonishment fairly overcame me. I didn&#8217;t say
it, though, but it was my turn to be embarrassed,
and I hardly knew what to say.</p>

<p>Having got it out, Mr. Desmond fairly recovered
his equanimity. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I put the
idea away from me for a long time, but it would
persist in growing upon me, and I finally concluded
that perhaps it might contribute to the
happiness of <i>all</i> parties, so I have taken the
plunge. I hope you approve of it,&#8221; he added,
with a queer twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;With all my heart, sir,&#8221; I said earnestly; &#8220;and
I am sure it will be as pleasing as it is surprising
to us all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Throughout that afternoon I was restless, and
eager to get home to tell Bessie the wonderful
news. It was the longest afternoon I ever saw,
but at length it passed and I hurried home. As
Bessie met me at the door I said eagerly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got a surprise for you, deary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now I noticed for the first time that she was all
smiles and full of something that she was eager to
surprise me with. Simultaneously each recognized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>that the other had the secret already. Of course;
what a fool I was! Her mother naturally enough
would tell her while Mr. Desmond broke the matter
to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it jolly?&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Charlie, are you then so anxious to get
rid of poor, dear mamma?&#8221; she said, half reproachfully
and half teasingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, of course not, but it is really nice for
all of us, isn&#8217;t it now? She won&#8217;t be far off, you
know; we shall have our little home all to ourselves,
and Mr. Desmond will be a sort of guardian
for us. And as I said before, I think it is jolly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I must confess I do not altogether like
the idea of mamma marrying again, and I shall
miss her very much, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t help laughing at the little woman&#8217;s
demure countenance, as she said this. There was
a little trace of jealousy in her gentle heart&mdash;jealousy
so natural to women&mdash;at the idea of
another&#8217;s taking her mother off, just as that good
woman had been jealous at her taking off. I
accused her of it, and she repudiated the idea.</p>

<p>But everybody must admit that things had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>fallen out just right for all parties, and the shadow
was to be taken from our household by a
new burst of sunlight, without any heart-burning
for anybody, and with nothing but satisfaction for
all. It was arranged that the new marriage
should presently occur, and the mature couple
take a little trip, and surprise George and Clara
by being at the Fairview Hotel before them.
Their first knowledge of the turn of affairs was to
come when they arrived there late in August, and
found their new relations in possession. Bessie
and I were to join the party for a brief stay, and
so my perplexity was happily ended.</p>

<span class="caption">A HAPPY PROSPECT.</span></h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> landscape is lovely in these latter days of
August. The mountains are grand and solemn
in their everlasting silence. We are together
at the Fairview, and everybody feels free and
happy. There is no restraint, and our future prospects
are delightful. Before George left home in
June he had made application for a vacant chair
in the Medical College and presented his credentials
and testimonials. He expected nothing from
it, he said, but would leave me to look out and
see what decision was made. I had brought with
me the news of his appointment. I had also secured
for him the refusal of an elegant house which
had been suddenly vacated and offered for sale on
account of the failure in business of its owner. It
was very near our cottage, had lovely surroundings,
was beautifully furnished, and was to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>sold with all its contents. It has now been decided
between George and Mr. Desmond that it
shall be purchased at once, and shall become the
legal possession of Clara, being paid for out of
her ample fortune, now under her own control,
but not yet taken from her uncle&#8217;s keeping.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Desmond will take possession of
the city mansion, and I have no doubt that its
state and elegance will be fully kept up. I see
before me happy times for us all, and at last I
think we understand and appreciate each other.
Our relations being properly and happily adjusted,
there will be no more &#8220;unpleasantness.&#8221; And I
must acknowledge that, in spite of past feelings
and the little clouds that have flecked our sky,
sometimes appearing dark and portentous, these
happy results are due in no small measure to
